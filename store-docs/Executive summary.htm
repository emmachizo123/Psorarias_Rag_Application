<p class=MsoNormal><b>Background</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Psoriatic&nbsp;arthritis (PsA) is defined as a unique
inflammatory arthritis affecting the joints and connective tissue, and is
associated with psoriasis of the skin or nails, which, because it involves both
skin and joints, can result in significant impairment of quality of life (QoL)
and psychosocial disability. Owing to the lack of a precise definition and
diagnostic marker for PsA, it is difficult to gauge its exact prevalence. The
UK-adjusted prevalence of PsA in the primary care setting has been estimated to
be 0.3%. Etanercept (Enbrel<sup>®</sup>), infliximab (Remicade<sup>®</sup>) and
adalimumab (Humira<sup>®</sup>) are biologic agents that target tumour necrosis
factor (TNF) activity in the treatment of PsA. All three agents are licensed in
the UK for the treatment of active and progressive PsA in adults when the
response to previous disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been
inadequate.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Objective</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>To determine the clinical effectiveness, safety and
cost-effectiveness of etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment
of active and progressive PsA in patients who have an inadequate response to
standard treatment (including DMARD therapy).</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK109474/"
title="Go to other sections in this page">Go to:</a></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Systematic reviews of the evidence on clinical efficacy,
safety and cost-effectiveness of etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab in the
treatment of PsA were performed. Data for the review were sought systematically
from 10 electronic databases [including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)] up to June 2009. Industry
submissions were searched for additional unpublished data. Randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) (including open-label extensions) were included in the
evaluation of efficacy. Safety data were sought from RCTs and observational
studies reporting serious adverse events [serious infections, malignancies and
activation of tuberculosis (TB)] for a minimum of 500 patients in any
indication receiving one or more of the biologic agents of interest. The
primary efficacy outcomes were measures of anti-inflammatory response [Psoriatic&nbsp;Arthritis
Response Criteria (PsARC), American College of Rheumatology 20% Improvement
Criteria (ACR 20)], skin lesion response [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
(PASI)] and functional status [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)]. The
safety outcome was the incidence of serious adverse events. The primary measure
of cost-effectiveness was incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted
life-year (QALY).</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Standard meta-analytic techniques were applied to
efficacy data. In addition, in the absence of head-to-head comparison on the
relative efficacy between the alternative biologics, an indirect comparison was
undertaken using Bayesian methods. A narrative synthesis was used for adverse
event data. Published cost-effectiveness studies and the economic analyses
submitted to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
by the biologic manufacturers were reviewed. An economic model was developed by
updating the model produced by the York Assessment Group for the previous NICE
appraisal of biologics in PsA. This model was revised to evaluate the impact of
biologics on both skin and joint disease and to include new evidence from the
clinical review and evidence synthesis.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK109474/"

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Results</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Efficacy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Six RCTs were identified for the evaluation of clinical
efficacy (43 publications). The six RCTs comprised two RCTs in patients with
PsA for each of the three agents. All trials were double-blind and
placebo-controlled RCTs. All trials were rated ‘good’ by the quality
assessment.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Pooled estimates of effect demonstrated a significant
improvement in patients with PsA for all joint disease and functional status
outcomes at 12–14 weeks' follow-up. The biologic treatment significantly
reduced joint symptoms assessed by PsARC for etanercept [relative risk (RR)
2.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96 to 3.45], infliximab (RR 3.44, 95% CI
2.53 to 4.69) and adalimumab (RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.88). This was
consistent with the results from the pooled estimates of ACR 20. Furthermore,
the statistically significant reduction in HAQ score also indicated a
beneficial effect of these biologic therapies on patients' functional status.
Significant heterogeneity was observed only in the outcome of PsARC in
infliximab. The 24-week data for all three biologics demonstrated that the
treatment effects are maintained. Trial data demonstrate a significant effect
of all three biologics on skin disease in terms of PASI response, at 12 or 24
weeks.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The results of evidence synthesis found that infliximab
appears to be the most effective of the three biologics. Across all outcomes of
joint and skin disease at 12 weeks, infliximab is associated with the highest
probabilities of response. The response in joint disease (PsARC and ACR) is
greater with etanercept than with adalimumab, whereas the response in skin
disease (PASI) is greater with adalimumab than with etanercept, although these
differences are not statistically significant. In those patients who achieve a
PsARC response to treatment the highest mean reductions in the functional and
psychological impact of the disease, measured by HAQ, are seen with infliximab
and etanercept (&#8722;0.657 for infliximab and &#8722;0.630 for etanercept).
For all three biologics the changes in HAQ for those patients who did not
respond to treatment were below the minimum clinically significant threshold
(&#8722;0.3).</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Short-term radiographic measures indicate that these
agents can slow disease progression in the short term (&lt; 24 weeks). The
available follow-up data, although promising, are inadequate to determine if
these effects persist in the longer term.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Safety</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Thirty-two relevant studies were identified for the
evaluation of safety of these biologics. The rates of serious infection were
etanercept 0.6%–13.2%, infliximab 0.8%–13.8% and adalimumab 0.4%–5.1%. The
rates of malignancy were etanercept 1%–5.7%, infliximab 0.16%–5.1% and
adalimumab 0.1%–1.1%. The rates of activation of TB for the treatment were
etanercept 0%–1.4%, infliximab 0.06%–4.6% and adalimumab 0%–0.4%.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Cost-effectiveness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Six cost-effectiveness studies were identified in the
literature review: three published models and three submissions from
manufacturers. The published models estimated that the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etanercept versus palliative care was
between £26,000 and £38,000 per QALY, but did not consider the impact of
biologics on the skin component of PsA. Abbott [Abbott Laboratories Ltd.
Adalimumab (HUMIRA):&nbsp;<i>Multiple technology appraisal of adalimumab,
etanercept and infliximab for&nbsp;psoriatic&nbsp;arthritis National Institute

Abbott Laboratories Ltd; 2009] estimated an ICER for adalimumab of £30,000,
with etanercept dominated by adalimumab, and an ICER for infliximab versus
adalimumab of £199,000. Schering-Plough [Schering-Plough.&nbsp;<i>REMICADE

Clinical Excellence: Welwyn Garden City: Schering-Plough Ltd; 2009] concluded
that the most cost-effective strategy depended on patient weight. (Since the
production of this report, Schering-Plough has merged with Merck.) Wyeth [Wyeth

cost-effectiveness of etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment

estimated an ICER for etanercept of £12,000 compared with DMARDs.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The de novo York Assessment Group model evaluated the
cost-effectiveness of the three biologic therapies and palliative care only.
Under base-case assumptions, for patients with PsA and mild-to-moderate skin
disease, the ICER etanercept versus palliative care is about £18,000 per QALY,
and the ICER of infliximab versus etanercept is about £44,000 per QALY.
Adalimumab is extendedly dominated. The probability that etanercept is
cost-effective is 0.436 at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY and 0.475 at a threshold
of £30,000 per QALY. The expected lifetime prescription costs of biologic
therapies is considerably greater than offset cost savings elsewhere in the
NHS.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>For patients with PsA and moderate-to-severe skin disease
who continue on biologics after 3 months if they respond for skin or joints,
the ICER of adalimumab versus palliative care is about £16,000 per QALY, the
ICER of etanercept versus adalimumab is about £21,000 per QALY and the ICER for
infliximab versus etanercept is about £26,000 per QALY. If the
cost-effectiveness threshold were £20,000 per QALY then all biologics have a
similar probability of being cost-effective.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>For patients with PsA with negligible skin involvement,
the ICER of etanercept versus palliative care is about £18,000 per QALY, and
the ICER of infliximab versus etanercept is about £65,000 per QALY. Adalimumab
is extendedly dominated in this group.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The second-line use of biologics was explored in a
sensitivity analysis. As these results are based on non-randomised comparisons
they should be considered with caution. For patients with PsA and
mild-to-moderate psoriasis who have failed adalimumab or infliximab as
first-line therapy for either adverse events or inefficacy, the ICER for
etanercept is &lt; £20,000 per QALY. For patients who have failed etanercept as
first-line therapy for either adverse events or inefficacy, the ICER for
adalimumab is &lt; £20,000 per QALY and the ICER for infliximab is &lt; £30,000
per QALY.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>These results are sensitive to several model assumptions
and alternative sources of data.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Despite the limited data, there was clear evidence of a
significant improvement for all the biologic therapies on the joint disease
condition and functional status of patients with PsA at short-term follow-up.
There was also some evidence of beneficial effects for these agents on the skin
disease response, although data on this outcome is sparse in PsA. There was a
paucity of long-term data on joint disease progression. An indirect comparison
of the three agents indicates that infliximab is associated with the highest
probability of response on joint and skin outcomes. The range of serious
adverse events did not differ considerably between agents, although there was
considerable uncertainty around these estimates.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The Assessment Group found that under base-case
assumptions, etanercept is most likely to be the cost-effective strategy for
patients with PsA and mild-to-moderate psoriasis if the threshold for
cost-effectiveness was £20,000 or £30,000 per QALY. All biologics have a
similar probability of being cost-effective for patients with PsA and
moderate-to-severe psoriasis at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>A number of outstanding uncertainties include:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bayesian indirect comparison analyses provide evidence
     of the relative efficacy of these biologics; however, those findings may

 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The patients in most trials are not precisely
     representative of the population recommended for biologics in current

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Implication for service provision</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The limited data indicate that etanercept, infliximab
     or adalimumab is efficacious in the treatment of PsA compared with
     placebo, with beneficial effects on joint symptoms, functional status and
     skin. Short-term data suggest that these three biologic agents can delay
     joint disease progression.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Despite such limited data from PsA trials in the
     evaluation of efficacy of these biologics, the evidence to support their
     use in the treatment of PsA is convincing, given the size of treatment
     effect and quality of data.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>An indirect analysis found that across all outcomes at
     12 weeks (PsARC, ACR and PASI) infliximab is associated with the highest
     probability of response. In those patients who achieve a PsARC response to
     treatment, the highest mean reductions in HAQ are seen with infliximab and
     etanercept.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>This review cannot rule out concerns about an increased
     risk of serious adverse events (serious infection, malignancy and
     activation of latent TB) of the biologics investigated.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The Assessment Group found that, under base-case
     assumptions, etanercept would be considered the most cost-effective
     strategy for patients with PsA and minimal or mild-to-moderate psoriasis
     if the threshold for cost-effectiveness were £20,000–30,000 per QALY.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>All biologics have a similar probability of being
     cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 per QALY for patients with PsA
     and moderate-to-severe psoriasis, if patients who respond at 3 months for
     either skin disease or joint disease continue with biologic therapy.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>In a secondary analysis, etanercept appeared most
     likely to be cost-effective at a threshold of £20,000 or £30,000 per QALY
     for patients with PsA and mild-to-moderate psoriasis who have failed
     adalimumab or infliximab as first-line therapy for either adverse events
     or inefficacy.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>For patients with PsA and mild-to-moderate psoriasis
     who have failed etanercept as first-line therapy for either adverse events

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Recommendations for research</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Long-term observational studies with large sample sizes
     of patients with PsA are required to demonstrate that beneficial effects
     for joint and skin disease and improvement of function are maintained. In
     particular, data on the effects of joint disease progression (e.g.
     radiographic assessment), and long-term HAQ progression while responding
     to biologic agents and health-related quality of life are required.
     Withdrawal rates due to lack of efficacy and adverse events should also be
     reported.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Further monitoring of the safety profiles of the
     biologic agents [e.g. through the British Society for Rheumatology
     Biologics Register (BSRBR)] is required. Future research should also
     establish whether long-term patterns of adverse events of these biologic
     agents in PsA are similar to those in RA.</b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Further investigation is required to reduce
     uncertainties around the following parameters identified in the economic
     model:</b></li>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Biologic therapy may be indicated to treat both joints
disease and psoriasis. Clinical response at 3 months is measured using the
PsARC for joints and PASI 75 for skin conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because there are two response variables, there are four
possible outcomes at 3 months: skin response only, joints response only,
response of both and response of neither. Furthermore, the PsARC and PASI 75
responses are not necessarily independent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The meta-analysis in&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta1510/ch3/">Chapter 3</a>&nbsp;estimated
the marginal probability of each type of response. However, this analysis did
not estimate the bivariate probability, that is, the probability of observing
both a response on arthritis and skin disease together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This appendix shows how the bivariate probability density
function (pdf) of PASI 75 and PsARC was estimated from the clinical trial
evidence, to be used in the decision model for patients who have both skin and
arthritis involvement at baseline, and assessed for PASI and PsARC responses at
3 months.</p>
