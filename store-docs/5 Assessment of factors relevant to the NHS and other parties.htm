<p class=MsoNormal><b>5 Assessment of factors relevant to the NHS and other
parties</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The results of this technology assessment have some
implications for clinical practice. At present, most patients with PsA who
receive biologic therapy are managed by a rheumatologist. However, patients
with PsA primarily concerned with improvements in their skin may benefit from
being managed by a dermatologist who can tailor any ongoing topical therapy
appropriately. Some patients with severe skin and joint disease may need dual
management of both specialties, although it has implications in terms of additional
administration, costs and communication between the specialties and primary
care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For patients with joint disease who respond to biologic
treatment, potential cost savings might include reduced need for contact with
services (e.g. physiotherapy) and monitoring costs for certain DMARDs. For
patients responding in terms of skin disease, there may be the potential for
avoiding inpatient admissions resulting from severe psoriasis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a choice of measures available for assessing joint
response (ACR or PsARC). BSR guidelines currently recommend PsARC, but also
suggest this is supplemented with measures of HAQ, ESR and CRP. The choice of
outcome measure will therefore have resource use as well as methodological
implications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mode of delivery varies among the biologics included in
this evaluation. Provision of infliximab requires the treatment centre to have
the appropriate capacity in terms of staff and facilities to delivered
scheduled i.v. infusions of the agent. In contrast, etanercept and adalimumab
are delivered by self-administered injection. This may have short-term
implications for initial training of patients, although with potential cost
savings in the longer term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the rate of serious adverse events for these biologic
agents has yet to be well established, all patients should be monitored by a
specialist. In addition, relevant data for the BSRBR should be collected and
appropriate measures for infection screening should be used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The potential benefits of these agents on physical function
and QoL might result in reduced demand on social services and carers, and the
potential (although not yet fully demonstrated) for slowing disease progression
could potentially reduce the demand for joint replacement surgery and
associated services.</p>
