<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chapter 4Evidence synthesis: relative efficacy of
treatments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The effectiveness of SEC and CZP has been summarised
in&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/">Chapter
3</a>.</i>&nbsp;Results for the main outcome measures, ACR, PsARC, PASI, HAQ-DI
and HAQ-DI conditional on PsARC, for all the comparator agents (ETN, ADA, INF,
GOL, UST and APR), have also been presented. These data indicate that all these
agents demonstrate statistically significant clinical efficacy in PsA. In order
to determine the relative efficacy of these agents it would be ideal to have
the results from good-quality adequately powered RCTs comparing active
treatments with one another. However, as the evidence base is made up almost
entirely of comparisons with placebo, statistical methods for making indirect
comparisons, such as a NMA, should be considered. NMA enables the comparison of
multiple treatments using both direct comparisons of interventions within RCTs and
indirect comparisons across trials based on a common comparator.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>111</sup></a>&nbsp;As
suggested by the term, NMA needs a ‘network of evidence’ to be established
between all of the interventions of interest. The drugs being evaluated here
all have a common comparator: placebo. It is this common comparator that allows
the network between SEC, CZP and all the active comparators to be established
and to provide information on the benefits of these agents relative to placebo
and each other. The relevant comparators included in the evidence base are
presented in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table38/?report=objectonly"

<p class=MsoNormal>Four separate outcomes were considered. Three outcomes were
included in the NMA to inform the economic model: PsARC response; change of
HAQ-DI score conditional on PsARC response; and PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90
responses. In addition, ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses were analysed, as
ACR response is the primary outcome in most of the included trials. Trials with
data suitable for the NMA are identified in&nbsp;<i><a

12-week time point were used, when available, otherwise data relating to the
closest time point after 12 weeks were used (normally 14 or 16 weeks). Not all
trials provided data for all of the outcomes analysed.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Framework of analyses</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evidence synthesis was undertaken using WinBUGS (version
1.4.3; MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK). WinBUGS is a Bayesian analysis
software tool that, through the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,
evaluates posterior distributions for the parameters of interest given
likelihood functions derived from data and prior probabilities (uninformative
priors were used throughout). There were few individual studies on each
treatment; therefore, fixed-effect models were used across studies in all analyses.
Parameter estimates for all functional parameters were reported from the
models. These differ by outcome, and further details are presented in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/#s4-2-1-2">Methods</a><span
style='font-style:normal'>. Treatment effects were expressed in relation to
placebo. Owing to the sparse evidence imposing a high level of uncertainty over
estimates of functional parameters, point estimates are medians throughout.
Some models assumed exchangeability across treatments within a class, that is,
different treatments of the same class were assumed to be similar, rather than
equal. Within such models we reported the relative effectiveness estimates for
each treatment (called shrunken estimates), rather than the class means,
allowing us to represent any residual differences across treatments.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The validity of a NMA depends on an assumption of
homogeneity/exchangeability between all the trials included in the network
[i.e. that there are no essential differences between the methods, populations
and interventions being studied, and that any differences are a result of
chance (as in a standard meta-analysis)]. The lack of
homogeneity/exchangeability between studies involving one of the treatments of
interest and studies involving the other treatments of interest may generate
inconsistency. Checking for consistency in the current network was not possible
because of the lack of trials that directly compare active agents. Our
examination of the study details and patient characteristics (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/">Chapter 3</a>,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/#s3-3">Characteristics
of the randomised controlled trials included in the systematic review of
short-term efficacy</a><span style='font-style:normal'>) identified that the
trials of the newer agents (SEC, CZP, UST and APR) included
biologic-experienced patients as well as biologic-naive patients. Given that it
is evident from large observational data sets (see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/">Chapter 3</a>,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/#s3-6">Review of
anti-tumour necrosis factor patient registry studies</a><span style='font-style:
normal'>) that efficacy response rates in biologic-experienced patients are
lower than in biologic-naive patients, it was considered inappropriate to
conduct an ‘all-patients’ NMA for any outcome, and that, instead,
biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients should be analysed separately.
Therefore, separate analyses (separate networks) for treatment-naive and
treatment-experienced patients were constructed for each of the four outcomes:
one each for PsARC, HAQ-DI conditional on PsARC, PASI 50, 75 and 90, and ACR
20, 50 and 70 responses. A summary of the trials reporting data on each of
these outcomes is presented in&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table39/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 39</a><span style='font-style:normal'>. It should be noted
that the NICE scope<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>112</sup></a>&nbsp;for
the present appraisal subdivides biologic-naive patients into those who have
not responded to one cDMARD and those who have not responded to two cDMARDs.
However, sufficient data were not available for these further levels of
subgroup analysis.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As discussed in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/">Chapter 3</a>,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/#s3-4">Evaluating the
secukinumab and certolizumab pegol trial results in comparison with other
treatments</a><span style='font-style:normal'>, another important difference
between the included trials is the observed results in the placebo arms,
particularly for PsARC (see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table40/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 40</a><span style='font-style:normal'>), PASI outcomes
(see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table50/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 50</a><span style='font-style:normal'>) and ACR (see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table56/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 56</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). Our investigations
on trial designs and patient characteristics did not identify any clear reasons
for such differences, other than that placebo response rates appear to have
increased over time. This observation (termed ‘placebo creep’) has been made in
several other areas of clinical research and its impact on indirect treatment
comparisons has been discussed.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>113</sup></a>&nbsp;In
the current review, across all trials, the PsARC placebo response rates are
high, but are much higher in more recently conducted trials, and this has
implications when interpreting unadjusted effect estimates. This is because the
ceilings (maximum values) of RRs are limited by baseline response rates. For
example, in the FUTURE 2 trial,<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;the
placebo response rate for PsARC in the biologic-naive subgroup was
(confidential information has been removed), which meant that the maximum
possible RR would be (confidential information has been removed); this maximum
result is lower than some of the actual RRs for other biologics (see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table40/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 40</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). Higher placebo
rates therefore appear to dilute effect estimates somewhat. This is also
demonstrated by the examining the RRs moving up the ACR outcome thresholds from
ACR 20 to ACR 70, which generally increase (see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s3/table/table29/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 29</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). However, it is not
clear exactly how these varying placebo rates will affect treatment effects
when calculated using ORs. The evidence synthesis – which was based on ORs –
therefore explored a potential relationship between baseline risk and relative effectiveness.
The NMA explored scenarios where a metaregression on baseline risk (i.e.
placebo response) was implemented for PsARC, PASI and ACR outcomes, which
imposes an interaction effect between baseline risk and relative effectiveness.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>The nine active treatments were categorised into three
classes (anti-TNF, anti-IL and APR). Outcome data for GOL, INF and APR at 14–16
weeks, and for UST at 24 weeks, were included in the analysis and assumed
equivalent to outcomes at 12 weeks. The inclusion of the 24-week PsARC data for
UST was based on an assumption that they fairly reflected the 12-week results
(subgroup results for PsARC at 12 weeks in the PSUMMIT 2 trial<a

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The NMA implemented separate models for the pooling of
treatment effects and of placebo responses. We first implemented a model with
independent treatment effects across treatments. Then a number of alternative
models were implemented to explore the possibility of placebo response, and,
within this, whether or not there was similarity between treatment effects for
treatments of the same class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Exploring placebo response as a treatment effect modifier</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An examination of individual trial results suggests that
studies presenting higher placebo rates report lower relative effectiveness
estimates (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/app3/">Appendix 3</a>,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/app3/#app3-3-1">Detailed
methods for the biologic-naive subpopulation</a><span style='font-style:normal'>).
In addition, recent trials, which evaluate newer treatments, also tend to show
higher placebo response rates. For example, a recent study on 300&#8201;mg of
SEC showed a placebo response rate of 46% (the FUTURE 2 trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>48</sup></a>), which
is much higher than that reported in an earlier study evaluating ETN, of 23%
(Mease&nbsp;</span>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>53</sup></a>). Our
investigations regarding trial designs and patient characteristics did not
identify a clear reason for such differences, although placebo response rates
appear to have increased over time. We investigated the effect of placebo
response as a potential treatment effect modifier. It should be noted that the
source of any relationship between placebo response and treatment effect is
unclear, and the reader should interpret the results carefully and with
caution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To account for the differences in placebo response rates
across the trials, a metaregression was undertaken. The baseline risk estimated
for each trial within the synthesis model was used as the adjustment covariate.
This allows for uncertainty in the estimation of baseline risk to be considered
in the adjustment alongside any correlation with the log-ORs. Note that the
baseline risk is expressed as the log-odds of PsARC response in the placebo
arm. As typical of metaregression, the relationship between the treatment
effect and baseline risk is defined by an interaction term (beta).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the independent treatment-effects analysis, beta is
estimated by comparing the treatment effects across multiple studies on the
same treatment with different placebo response rates. Within the evidence base,
not all treatments present with multiple trials. Thus, only a subset of
treatments contribute evidence to estimate beta: ADA (ADEPT<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>55</sup></a>&nbsp;and
Genovese&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>56</sup></a>), ETN
(Mease&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>53</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>54</sup></a>) and APR
(the PALACE 1,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>60</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>61</sup></a>&nbsp;PALACE
2<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>61</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>65</sup></a>&nbsp;and
PALACE 3<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>61</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>65</sup></a>&nbsp;trials).
This limitation in the evidence base meant that the beta had to be assumed to
be independent of treatment (i.e. equal for all treatments). Moreover, the
evidence base also showed that studies on the same treatment report reasonably
similar placebo response rates. This may limit the validity of inferences over
beta. For example, the Genovese&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>56</sup></a>&nbsp;and
ADEPT<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>55</sup></a>&nbsp;studies
report placebo response rates of 27% and 26%, respectively, whereas across the
whole set of studies the placebo response range from 21% to (confidential
information has been removed).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As inferences on beta are drawn from differences between
trials, the smallest difference in placebo rates corresponds to the maximum
possible influential difference in reported treatment effects. The two trials
on ADA (ADEPT<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>55</sup></a>&nbsp;and
Genovese&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>56</sup></a>)
illustrate this perfectly: the small (1%) difference in placebo response is
associated with a 10% difference in response rate in the treatment group (from
51% to 61%). These data are thus influential to estimates of beta. Of the
studies that contribute to inferences on beta, two trials have the smallest
sample size of the whole set of trials: Mease&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>53</sup></a>&nbsp;(ETN)
and Genovese&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>56</sup></a>&nbsp;(ADA).
Given this, a sensitivity analysis excluding both Mease&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a

Genovese&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Exploring treatment effects as class</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the context of an adjusted model for placebo response, we
explored the possibility of there being class effects. Three different class
groupings were considered: all treatments as a single class; all biologics as a
class with APR separate; and, to reflect the pharmacology, anti-TNFs grouped,
ILs grouped and APR separate. Additionally, for the last two groupings, we
explored two within-class assumptions: assuming treatments within a class to
have equal effectiveness and, alternatively, that treatments within a class
have similar (exchangeable) effectiveness. Fixed effects across studies were
assumed for all models. We did not consider models assuming exchangeability
between classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Key assumptions of models implemented for the evidence
synthesis of PsARC response</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Model A1 considers the effectiveness of treatments as
independent of each other. Model B1 considers the relative effectiveness of the
alternative treatments as independent of each other, but that they all depend
on the response in the placebo arm. Models C1, C2 and C3 consider the
treatments as equal in terms of their effectiveness within class, but dependent
on the effect of the placebo arm. Models D1 and D2 assume the treatments to
have a similar, but not equal, effectiveness that is dependent on the effect of
the placebo arm; this model introduces more flexibility than assuming treatment
effects to be equal (models C2 and C3), but does not fully assume treatments to
differ as in model A1. It allows for differences between the effectiveness of
treatments that we may not be able to explain but that we should consider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As stated earlier, sensitivity analysis around the
adjustment for placebo response were performed: sets of analyses (models A1,
B1, C1, C2, C3, D1 and D2) were conducted for PsARC response, excluding the

(median) of treatments analysed (including the studies of Genovese&nbsp;<i>et

<p class=MsoNormal>The unadjusted model A1 indicates an appropriate model fit
(with residual deviance close to the number of data points informing the
model). The placebo response-adjusted model B1 fits well compared with the
unadjusted model A1 [it presents a smaller deviance information criterion (DIC)
and residual deviance, but not significantly so, as the difference in DIC is
&lt;&#8201;5&#8201;points].<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>115</sup></a>&nbsp;Model
B1 imposes an association between the log-odds of placebo response and
treatment effect. The estimated beta implies that a trial with a higher odds of
a placebo response is expected to report smaller treatment effects. Consider
300&#8201;mg of SEC in unadjusted model A1: the treatment effect is evaluated
at 1.178, but the studies on this treatment have a higher log-odds of placebo
response than those on other anti-TNFs. The treatment effects reported in the
adjusted model assume all treatments were trialled with the same baseline risk.
Thus, after adjustment with the placebo response in model B1, the treatment
effect estimate for 300&#8201;mg of SEC is higher (2.110). This is why the
results (and rankings) generated by model B1 are very different from the
observed trial results and results generated by the model A1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the assumptions imposed by the placebo-adjusted
model may be difficult to justify, or counteract, the limitations in the
evidence base that underlie inferences also limit interpretation. First, the
distinction between treatment effects and placebo effect is unclear. This is
because newer treatments tested under higher placebo response rates show lower
treatment effects, whereas older treatments tested under lower placebo response
rates show higher treatment effects. There is also limited evidence on the
effects of different placebo response rates for the newer treatments (SEC and
CZP), as these drugs were studied in a single trial each.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have further explored treatment effects as class. Model
C1, which assumes that all treatments are equal, does not fit well with the
existing data as it shows a much increased residual deviance. Models C2 and C3,
which assume treatment equal within their class (model C2 separates APR from
other drugs and model C3 separates ILs, anti-TNFs and APR), also do not fit
well with the existing data, resulting in higher residual deviance and DIC.
Models D1 and D2, however, relax the assumption of equality and apply a class
effect where treatments within a class are assumed to be similar, not equal.
These models fit equally well when compared with model B1 (similar DIC and
residual deviance).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In all models exploring treatment effects as a class, the
interaction term (beta) is negative. Among the best-fitting models (B1, D1 and
D2), the more negative interaction term is observed in model B1. The
interaction terms are similar between models D1 and D2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In sensitivity analyses, we explored the effect of excluding
the studies of Genovese&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>56</sup></a>&nbsp;and
Mease&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>53</sup></a>&nbsp;on

results for the biologic-naive subpopulation</a><span style='font-style:normal'>&nbsp;for

absolute value.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>53</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Preferred models</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The unadjusted model A1 fits the data as well as any of the
other models and generates results that reflect the observed results of
individual trials. Alternatively, we considered a model adjusted for placebo
response. Despite no clear rationale for why placebo response rate should
affect the treatment effect, when allowing for such an association (model B1),
lower treatment effects are expected with higher placebo response rates. The
results (and rankings) attained with model B1 are very different to those
evaluated in model A1, and depend on the credibility of the association
assumed. Regarding possible class effects, the analyses found that an
assumption of equal class effect for the treatments does not produce a
better-fitting model (models C1, C2 and C3) than assuming independent treatment
effects (models A1 and B1) or similar treatment effects (models D1 and D2).
There was little difference in goodness-of-fit statistics (DIC and residual
deviance) between models D1 and D2, and we consider the exchangeable class
effect model (D2), which utilised two classes (anti-IL and anti-TNF) with APR
separate, to be the most clinically plausible.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>Network meta-analysis results: probability of PsARC response
and ORs by treatments in the biologic-naive subpopulation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The NMA that does not adjust for the placebo response finds
that SEC is more effective than CZP, and both are more effective than UST and
APR, but both are somewhat less effective than all comparator anti-TNFs. After
adjusting for the unexplained increase in placebo rates seen in more recent
trials (and, hence, of newer agents), and under a class effect that allows for
exchangeability for treatments within each class, the probability of a response
with SEC remains slightly higher than with CZP and both remain more effective
than UST and APR, but now their probability of response is similar to, or only
slightly less than, that of the anti-TNF comparators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These results indicate that, although SEC and CZP are
effective in terms of the PsARC outcome, the relative effectiveness of these
biologics compared with ETN, ADA, GOL, UST and INF and with each other, is
uncertain. Both agents do seem to be more effective than APR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The NMA conducted for the synthesis of data in the
biologic-experienced population is equal to that implemented in the
treatment-naive population: treatment effects are assumed to be independent and
the model assumed fixed effects across trials. The evidence for the

that the probability of a PsARC response is higher with SEC than with UST, but

<p class=MsoNormal>The observed HAQ-DI changes conditional on PsARC response

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We consider three models to estimate the HAQ-DI changes
conditional on PsARC responder or non-responder status. A detailed description
of the model and underlying assumptions are presented in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/app3/">Appendix 3</a>,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/app3/#app3-3-1">Detailed
methods for the biologic-naive subpopulation</a><span style='font-style:normal'>.
The model E1 considers that treatments are independent and considers fixed
effects across studies. Models E2 and E3 apply a class effect comprising three
groups: anti-TNFs, ILs and APR. This class effect reflects the best-fitting
class effect model for PsARC (see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/#s4-2-1-3">Network
meta-analysis results</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). The model E2
assumes that the treatments are similar within class (exchangeable) and
considers fixed effects across studies; and model E3 considers that the
treatments are equal within class and considers fixed effects across studies.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The results are presented as absolute changes in HAQ-DI

<p class=MsoNormal>Network meta-analysis results of HAQ-DI score changes
(median) conditional on PsARC response and non-response in the biologic-naive
subpopulation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The model fit statistics (DIC) indicate that neither class
effect model (E2 or E3) is a better fit for the data than the unadjusted,
independent treatments model (E1). The class effect models had similar fits,
but the one that allowed exchangeability within classes (E2) was considered to
be the most clinically plausible. For the purposes of the economic model,
in&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s6/">Chapter
6</a><span style='font-style:normal'>, models E1 and E2 were the preferred
models.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The results from the two preferred models are similar. The
results from the unadjusted independent treatment effects model found that
significant reductions in mean HAQ-DI score were achieved with response to all
nine treatments and response to placebo. However, patients who responded to
placebo achieved a lower level of improvement in the HAQ-DI score than those
who responded to active treatment. Furthermore, the improvement in response to
placebo is below the minimally important difference for PsA of –0.35.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>The median conditional on response HAQ-DI change was highest

CZP were worse than all treatments except for APR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of trial-specific data in the biologic-naive
subpopulation for PASI response outcome</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The NMA for PASI utilised a framework of analysis that
evaluated the probability of PASI responses in different categories of PASI
thresholds (50/75/90) within a single model:<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>117</sup></a>&nbsp;the
single model included all categories of PASI and generated a single effect
estimate for each treatment and also probabilities of achieving PASI 50, PASI
75 and PASI 90.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reflecting the analyses on PsARC, alternative assumptions
were tested in two analyses. The first analysis assumed independent treatment
effects and did not include any metaregression for placebo effects (model F1).
As the number of trials to inform each treatment effect was small, a
fixed-effect model was used. In a second analysis, we explored the impact on
treatment effects of adjusting for placebo responses [i.e. baseline effects
(metaregression model)]. As can be seen in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table50/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 50</a><span style='font-style:normal'>, there were large
differences between trials for PASI responses in the placebo arms, ranging
between 0% (in IMPACT<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>51</sup></a>)
and 27% (in RAPID-PsA<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>47</sup></a>).
The IMPACT<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>51</sup></a>&nbsp;had
a very small sample size and reported 0% response in the placebo arm and 100%
response in the treatment arm, which lead to very extreme values for placebo
adjustment. Therefore, IMPACT<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>51</sup></a>&nbsp;could
not be included in the metaregression analysis. Unlike the analysis for PsARC,
for PASI, we did not assume a class effect as the evidence from individual
trials does not support such an assumption.&nbsp;</span><a

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of trial-specific data in the biologic-naive
subpopulation for ACR response outcome</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As ACR is, like PASI, a categorical variable (ACR 20, ACR 50
and ACR 70), the NMA for ACR utilised a similar framework of analysis to that
used to estimate the probability of PASI responses: all categories of ACR were
within a single model which generated a single effect estimate for each
treatment and also probabilities of achieving an ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Analogously to the analyses on PsARC, sets of alternative
analyses were conducted for ACR response outcomes. We explored the effect of
differences in trial-specific placebo responses on treatment effect by
undertaking a metaregression. In the context of an adjusted model for placebo
response, we explored the possibility of there being class effects. Three
different class groupings were considered: all treatments as a single class;
all biologics as a class with APR separate; and, to reflect the pharmacology,
anti-TNFs grouped, ILs grouped and APR separate. In addition, we explored two
within-class assumptions: assuming treatments within a class to have equal
effectiveness and, alternatively, assuming that those treatments within a class
have similar (exchangeable) effectiveness. Fixed effects across studies were
assumed for all models. We have not considered models assuming exchangeability
between classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The placebo response-adjusted model I1 fits well compared
with the unadjusted model H1 (smaller DIC and residual deviance), but is not
significantly better. In addition, the results (rankings) generated by model I1
are very different from the observed trial results. Models J1, J2 and J3 do not
fit well with the existing data, resulting in a significantly higher residual
deviance and DIC. Both models K1 and K2 fit as well as the unadjusted model H1
(similar DIC and residual deviance).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among all the placebo response-adjusted models, models I1,
K1 and K2 show similar DIC and residual deviance, which means that these three
models fit the existing data equally well, although not significantly better
than the unadjusted model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The interaction term (beta) is negative in all models, which
means that higher placebo response rates in trials are associated with higher
treatment effects, demonstrating that adjustment for heterogeneity in the
placebo responses across trials was required. The interaction term varies
between models, but is similar between models K1 and K2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Preferred models</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The unadjusted model, H1, fits the data as well as any of
the other models and generates results that reflect the observed results.
Considering the placebo-adjusted models, model I1-generated results (rankings)
are very different from the observed trial results and the results generated by
model H1. Using an assumption of equal class effect for the treatments does not
produce a better-fitting model (models J1, J2, J3) than assuming independent
treatment effects (models H1, I1), or similar (exchangeable) treatment effects
(models K1, K2). In addition, there was a little difference in the
goodness-of-fit statistics (DIC and residual deviance) between models K1 and
K2, and we consider the exchangeable class effect model, which utilised two
classes (anti-ILs and anti-TNFs) with APR separate, to be the most clinically
plausible. Hence, our preferred models are models H1 and K2. Note that the
economic model uses PsARC; thus, these results were not implemented in the
economic model in&nbsp;<i><a

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary of findings of relative efficacy from network
meta-analysis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The NMA was conducted to formally investigate the relative
efficacy of SEC and CZP and the other active comparators. Analyses were
conducted on four outcomes: PsARC, HAQ-DI conditional on PsARC response, PASI
and ACR. Analyses were not run for the full-trial populations because of the
heterogeneity across trials, but instead were performed separately for the
biologic-naive and biologic-experienced subgroups. The data suggest the rate of
placebo response to be a potential source of heterogeneity within the biologic-naive
population networks, despite there being no clear rationale for such an effect.
For this reason, we explored models that adjust for the placebo response,
alongside unadjusted models.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Biologic-naive patients</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In terms of PsARC response, the results indicated that,
although SEC and CZP are effective, the relative effectiveness of these
biologics compared with ETN, ADA, GOL and INF, and with each other, is
uncertain, although both agents do seem to be more effective than APR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In terms of HAQ-DI conditional on PsARC response, the
results from the preferred adjusted model were similar to the independent
treatment effect analysis. The results from the unadjusted independent
treatment effects model showed that significant reductions in mean HAQ-DI score
were achieved with response to all nine treatments and response to placebo,
although the improvement in response to placebo is below the minimum clinically
significant threshold for PsA of –0.35.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>116</sup></a>&nbsp;The
median HAQ-DI score change was highest with INF and ETN, followed by
300&#8201;mg of SEC, but 150&#8201;mg of SEC and CZP were worse than all
treatments except for APR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The results of the unadjusted NMA for PASI, as a single
outcome or as separate categorical variables, indicated that all treatments
were more effective than placebo. The difference between treatments was
uncertain, with wide CrIs that mostly overlap with each other. The results
showed that patients treated with INF have the highest probability of achieving
PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90 responses. However, after adjustment for placebo,
300&#8201;mg of SEC has the highest probability of response. The probabilities
for CZP changed between the models. It appears to be less efficacious than all
other treatments, except APR and ETN, in achieving PASI responses in the
unadjusted model. However, in the adjusted model, CZP appears to be more
efficacious than GOL, UST, APR and ETN, and similar to ADA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, for ACR responses, differences between treatments
were uncertain, with wide CrIs that mostly overlapped with each other. The
unadjusted results suggested that patients taking SEC or CZP had lower
probabilities of a response than those for INF, ETN, GOL and ADA. After
adjustment for placebo response, the probabilities of a response for both SEC
and CZP increased; those for SEC were very similar to those for INF.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Biologic-experienced patients</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The evidence for the biologic-experienced subpopulation is
very sparse with only two trials evaluating two treatments. Hence, only two
treatments (SEC and UST) could be included in these analyses. The results
showed that, across all outcomes analysed, both SEC and UST were significantly
more effective than placebo. Most of the results suggested SEC may be better
than UST, although the results were uncertain with wide overlapping CrIs.</p>
