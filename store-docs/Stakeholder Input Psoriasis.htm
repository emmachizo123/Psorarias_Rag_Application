<p class=MsoNormal><b>Canadian Association of Psoriasis Patients and the
Canadian Psoriasis Network</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>About the Canadian Association of Psoriasis Patients
(CAPP) and the Canadian Psoriasis Network (CPN)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Canadian Association of Psoriasis Patients (CAPP) is
partnering with the Canadian Psoriasis Network (CPN) to develop this
submission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CAPP (<a href="http://www.canadianpsoriasis.ca/">www.canadianpsoriasis.ca</a>)
is a national, not-for-profit organization formed to better serve the needs of
psoriasis patients across the country. CAPP’s mission is to be a resource and
advocate for psoriatic patients and their families to improve patient care and
quality of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CPN (<a href="http://www.canadianpsoriasisnetwork.com/">www.canadianpsoriasisnetwork.com</a>)
is a national, not-for-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality
of life of people in Canada who live with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
CPN does this by providing current information on research and treatment
options and by working with others to build awareness and advocacy about the
complexities of these conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Information Gathering</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CAPP and CPN collaborated with the Arthritis Society
(arthritis.ca), the Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance (arthritispatient.ca),
and Creaky Joints Canada (creakyjoints.ca) to develop a survey in English using
Survey Monkey that asked patients and caregivers about their experiences with
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and the treatment under review (guselkumab or
Tremfya). Each organization participated in the development of the survey and
shared the surveys with their respective memberships or patient communities via
their communication channels (e.g., websites, social media channels,
newsletters, etc.). CAPP and CPN analyzed the data and prepared this
submission.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The survey was&nbsp;<b>available</b>&nbsp;from April 20,
     2022 to May 16, 2022. Overall, there were&nbsp;<b>71 responses</b>&nbsp;to
     the survey: 12 respondents were from British Columbia (17.1%), 7 from
     Alberta (10.0%), 3 from Manitoba (4.3%), 34 from Ontario (48.6%), 4 from
     Quebec (5.7%), 4 from New Brunswick (5.7%), 4 from Nova Scotia (5.7%), 3
     from Newfoundland &amp; Labrador (4.3%); no responses were received from
     Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Yukon, the Northwest Territories or
     Nunavut.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>In addition to PsA</b>, 68.0% of 25 respondents (n=17)
     indicated they lived with psoriasis, 24.0% (n=6) live with another
     inflammatory condition, 48.0% (n=12) also live with another type of
     arthritis, and 32.0% (n=8) live with at least one other condition,
     including osteoporosis, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, fibromyalgia,
     type 1 diabetes, herniated discs, rosacea, kidney problems, inflammatory
     bowel disease and Celiac disease.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Twenty-nine respondents provided information about
     their&nbsp;<b>gender</b>: 79.3% (n=23) were female, 20.7% (n=6) were male.
     As well, 29 respondents provided information about their&nbsp;<b>age</b>,
     which is grouped here for ease of reference: under 26 years old (n=0),
     26-34 years old (n=0), 35-44 years old (n=1), 45-54 years old (n=5), 55-64
     years old (n=12), 65-74 years old (n=8), and 75 years or older (n=3). When
     asked how else they might describe their experience, 6 respondents (20.7%)
     identified as&nbsp;<b>people with a disability</b>, and 67.0% of
     respondents identified as&nbsp;<b>White</b>.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Household income</b>&nbsp;levels of the 29 respondents
     who provided information represented a wide range.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Of 28 respondents, 57.1% (n=16) had&nbsp;<b>private
     insurance</b>, 21.4% (n=6) had coverage through a&nbsp;<b>public plan</b>,
     not including unemployment or disability supports, and 7.1% (n=2) had
     coverage through a&nbsp;<b>disability support program</b>. One respondent
     noted that they had reached the lifetime maximum on their private plan and
     were now covered through Nova Scotia’s provincial coverage.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>There were two responses from&nbsp;<b>people who have
     experience with Tremfya (guselkumab)</b>&nbsp;for PsA.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Disease Experience</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a form of arthritis linked to
psoriasis and that is chronic and progressive. This inflammatory disease causes
swelling and pain in multiple joints and can sometimes result in&nbsp;<b>permanent
and debilitating joint damage</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifty respondents identified&nbsp;<b>aspects</b>&nbsp;of
their day-to-day lives and quality of life that are&nbsp;<b>affected by PsA</b>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a

target=object>Table 1</a></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aspects of Day-to-Day Lives and Quality of Life Affected by
PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PsA can curtail or diminish participation in the workforce
and work opportunities. Among those who&nbsp;<b>miss work or school</b>&nbsp;because
of symptoms or side effects of PsA, 28.3% (n=13 out of 46 respondents) miss 1-3
days on average each month, 17.4% (n=8) miss 4-6 days, 2.2% (n=1) miss 7-10
days, 2.2% (n=1) miss 16-20 days and 6.5% (n=3) cannot work or attend school
due to PsA. Several respondents shared how their work lives had changed because
of their PsA:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“no longer able to work full time…just part time due to
fatigue, lack of grip strength in my hands, etc.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I take things day by day. I miss out on lots of things due
to pain and fatigue. I work shift work usually 4 hrs per shift any more, even
an hour, keeps me awake at night with agonizing foot and toe pain especially.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I push through but exhausted by the end of the working
day.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No longer able to work full time as a Nurse due to my PsA.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I always worked FTE &amp; now down to 3d/wk as a nurse
practitioner, I have daily fatigue, painful sore joints, my fingers with
tensosynovitis is now causing my keyboard work to become more difficult with
lagging fingers - extra letters etc. My fatigue is exhausting &amp; barely make
it though a full day of work &amp; need to sleep 11-12h /d for recovery. I
awaken multiple times a night with pain or numbness to digits causing
difficulty falling back to sleep. Losing contact with friends as cannot do evening
out. Most frustration is being told by rheumatologist that my condition falls
through the cracks in terms of financial support OHIP for TNFi which I need to
stop the progression of my enthesitis. I am currently seeking a second opinion
in [a large city].”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Cannot do much when hands and feet are flaring”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I only work online with a Modified work schedule. I’m not
able to do housework, exercise, socialize or travel like I used to.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For many respondents, their PsA&nbsp;<b>reduced their
mobility</b>&nbsp;and ability to participate in activities and impacted
their&nbsp;<b>mental and social health</b>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Can’t walk for long periods”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Had to stop running/walking because I need to stop or
reduce the diclofenac. Gained weight. Harder on the joints. A longer time to
work out the stiffness in the morning. Aches in the evening. Lethargy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I live very independently. The only difficulty I have is I
get tired more often and very occasionally have issues with my knees and
feet/ankles. Pain and swelling. Stairs can sometimes present an issue if it's
multiple stories. This happens after prolonged walking, standing or excessive
exercise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Walking any distance. Lifting grandchildren. Anything that
requires hand strength.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“PsA causes significant pain, fatigue, and the dexterity I
once had in my hands is severely deteriorated.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Joint stiffness impedes activities and being tired most of
the time makes one lose desire to participate in activities.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, it has affected what activities That I can still do.
For example because of my range of motion in my knee I can not play hockey any
More[. N] o support needed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“No motivation, mental health.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it comes to managing and completing everyday tasks,
many respondents told us that the pain and joint symptoms have reduced their
ability to complete activities of daily living on their own:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It has in the past – my hands are very week with two joint
replacements and a bit of pain - needing someone to help dress, cook, carry
things, everyday living tasks.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Challenges of doing everyday tasks like housekeeping,
shopping and travelling. Had to sell my home and move to apartment sooner than
necessary for my friends of similar age group. Challenges with sleep and being
able to visit certain areas or homes. Always balancing every day to stay
healthy and active. Travel is limited.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several respondents receive support from their spouse,
family and friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Due to me being a Nurse, I am able to pace myself to
complete my ADLs independently. I also have lots of support from my husband.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“None at the moment per se but spouse drives me to grocery
store and helps pack bags, does washing of dishes after I cook and bake. I do
not qualify for other supports from my community at the moment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Husband has taken on many chores and he and my family all
lend emotional support. I am very lucky.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Assistance with making meals in particular because opening
jars, peeling vegetables very difficult.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Spouse helps with errands, finances, cooking, cleaning.
Sister and father understand and provide emotional support. Friends do not
care.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others pay for services around the home, including housework
and yard work: “I hire a cleaning lady twice a month.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have a cleaning lady and several very good friends who
are on call to help with lifting groceries, retrieving heavy items at low or
high heights, packing for a trip, being on watch when with them so as not to
fall. Assist with meal prep and clean up. My family are not here.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Experiences With Currently Available Treatments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Respondents were asked about their experiences with
different PsA symptoms, and how effective they were at treating their PsA
symptoms:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a

target=object>Table 2</a></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Experiences with Different PsA Treatments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The survey asked how well their PsA was managed by
treatments they had previously tried. Some respondents told us that the drugs
they were currently taking were managing their symptoms well. Others shared
their experiences with the side effects (that made it difficult to continue
with those drugs), and their ongoing unmet needs with current treatments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Mostly side effects stopped me from using certain
medicines.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Side effects have been worse to manage than disease
symptoms in some cases. None of my need (pain control, swelling, quality of
life) have been managed with treatment to date.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Feeling sick to my stomach tired constant pain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Took naproxen for 10 years but no longer take it as it
ruined my stomach.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Stomach issues from ibuprofen, PsA effects my eyes and the
drops I use can exacerbate my symptoms if used too much.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All Dmards made me 'sick', severe drug hangover, tingling
in arms, nauseated. Celebrex caused GERD. Biologic is the best, but after 3
years, it's not working as well now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Over the counter Tylenol arthritis - Not well managed;
Diclofenac (daily)- very well managed steroidal meds didn do anything. Biweekly
injections [golimumab] do a relatively good job when combined with others.
Trying to get off the diclofenac because it’s so hard on my stomach. But
methotrexate didn’t help. So I’m trying a combo of other items. But the
diclofenac does it best for me. When taking 2 per day, I was able to run 5-10
Km per day. Without it, I ache. Daily.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hydrochloroquine caused ear pustules &amp; ++ ichiness
NSAIDs causes GERD &amp; IBS I have enthesitis as predominant feature with
tenosynovitis to fingers &amp; nail psoriasis”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Methotrexate controls the disease well but I spend one day
a week recovering from the injections. Mostly on the couch.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My rheumatologist won’t even talk about anything else and
doesn’t seem to grasp that living only 6 days a week is too much side effects.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Have to plan ahead to make sure I’m not scheduled for
anything on recovery day. I have to rest every afternoon or face the
consequences.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Side effects of Cosentyx are hard to tolerate and since
monthly injection at max amount it is only effective for 10 days after
injections, then back in flare.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Enbrel has worked wonders for me, sore to inject but worth
the relief of pain. All other medication tried did not work and lots of side
effects.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Side effects (Liver and skin) are monitored with blood
work, taking other meds to counter the adverse effects ..have a strong health
team including a Doctor of Chinese medicine and acupuncture.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Risks of malignancies</b>&nbsp;are elevated for people
with psoriatic disease:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have tried 3 different biological injections. My present
is Cymzia and is working well. I have concerns tho regarding possible side
effects ie cancers”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One responded who was undergoing treatment for cancer told
us about their experiences:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My PsA was doing well on Cosentyx until I was diagnosed
with Ovarian Cancer then had to stop Biologics, &amp; Methotrexate, now back on
Methotrexate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Side effects steroids weight gain and cancer. Side effects
methotrexate weak and sick. Nothing has helped much in 45 years. No quality of
life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Chemo finishes the end of May 2022 so treatment is less now
and will only go to Cancer Clinic once a month for blood work and IV Bone
treatment; kind of a wait and see for at least three months; no consideration
of my other autoimmune issues or support offered; still work with kidney
specialist but now on a three month basis with blood and urine requisition and
a consult by telephone or in-office. So my biggest concerns are kidney support,
eye support &amp; possible cataract eye surgery; concern about becoming a
diabetic due to medications taken; working on a plan of care as I move
forward.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite the availability of several treatment options, many
of which work well for people, there remain significant&nbsp;<b>unmet needs</b>&nbsp;for
people living today with PsA:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Overall health mental and physical takes a back seat to
just joint issues.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My inflammation markers continue to increase; my blood
sugars and blood pressure are rising, I have eye issues now, cataracts, due to
chemo medications and other autoimmune related symptoms. My body is very
sensitive to change, certain food sensitivities like histamines and oxalates.
stress, sleep issues, share symptoms of lupus and chronic inflammatory response
syndrome; I have various skin rashes and family history of various autoimmune
conditions. My MDs work in silos and do NOT consult each other &amp; I have to
do my own medical research to figure out my issues and possible solutions.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I still have pain in some joints all the time when I
exercise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not met, fatigue, swelling in hand joints and feet; poor
sleep. No side effects from Apremelist (otezla).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not managed very well at all, and my doc has been pushing
me to start methotrexate however I am reluctant to start it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I was told given enthesitis as my predominant feature I do
not qualify for biologics. My disease is worsening from my feet, hands, arms,
shoulder &amp; now neck. i am seeking a second opinion from another
rheumatologist as our local one said there is nothing left he can offer Tx.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Medications don't all work, I've spent hundreds of
dollars.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One respondent noted a change in the effectiveness of their
medication around the time they received COVID-19 immunizations:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Biologic was very effective until the 3rd [Pfizer] vaccine
shot.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The costs of medications</b>&nbsp;borne by patients
remain a significant barrier to accessing appropriate treatments that manage
the symptoms and guard against irreversible joint damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My present regime was covered by my insurance plan to the
cost of $4,000 every 3 months but since I’ve had to reduce my hours of work I’m
no longer covered. I’m a front line Nurse. I’ve had to use the Trillium Plan to
get my medication covered. I have to travel over 100 km to see my
Rheumatologist.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Yes, high cost of biologics. No drug benefit coverage,
under age 65.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Between Apremilast manufacturer and private health plan the
cost of the drug is free. If not for this coverage I would be on another
medication.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Prescribing particular treatment options: Expiration (life
time limit) of drug plans and provincial coverage do not cover the cost of some
drugs. Takes a great deal of time, dollars and energy to stay well and be able
to move.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For others,&nbsp;<b>travel and access to care</b>&nbsp;present
important barriers to optimal treatment of their PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I live 2.5 hours away from my Rheumatologist. This is a
problem since I do not drive. We have been able to manage my appointments with
phone appointments every 3 months. This has worked well. If I was having
problems with my disease or medications, etc., it would be problematic to have
in-person appointments. I live in a rural environment and there is very limited
access to specialists.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Covid has Dr shortages in my rural area has made it
difficult to get any treatment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Improved Outcomes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The survey asked respondents what they were looking for in
this treatment option or in a new treatment option. One person commented that
they wanted a treatment that would stop the disease process:&nbsp;<i>“Stop the
process of the disease, pain, easy access to support, medication. Being able to
function daily. Some side effects are tolerable.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other respondents emphasized that they wanted better
management of the symptoms that impact their lives, including reducing side
effects from the medications currently available, while being cautious about
needing to deal with new side effects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fewer side effects.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Alleviate fatigue.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Looking to get back to a regular exercise routine. That’s
my ultimate goal. Not as many stomach issues. Perhaps an easier time in the
mornings.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I really an not interested in changing my present
medication of Humira. I am to afraid of the pain I will feel changing. I have
had a flare up that even my jaw was in pain along with my whole body. I do not
want to go through that again although I may.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hopeful I would qualify to as after 10 days on current
treatment ( monthly injections) I go back to hardly being able to do daily
tasks or walk but I continuously push through. Would love to have that quality
of life and able to function and would absolutely accept side effects if less
pain and flares could happen. At this moment even a 15% improvement would be
amazing! This would help with less er visits, and in constant pain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Waiting for treatment to begin hoping for a big improvement
of my quality of life in every aspect. I am willing to try this treatment even
if I get enough relief to exercise again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have never taken this drug nor have I heard of it. I rely
on my Rheumatologist to present medication options to me that she feels would
be helpful. My medication is costly but I have good insurance. If I had to pay
for it myself I would likely look for a less expensive option. If I live
relatively pain free I consider that my medication is working. If my blood work
indicates elevated inflammation then it's discussed and treated. I have
researched my disease thoroughly but I rely on my doctor's expertise. The only
personal change I made was to my diet once I got diagnosed. I became a
vegetarian and i believe it helped me. I would not accept medication with too
many side effects, especially if they were long term. To me a medication is
working if it reduces my symptoms. Quality of life is everything to me. No one
wants to simply exist. Living pain free is always the goal.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What are the serious side effects? That sounds
intimidating. I want to be pain free though and would try anything to
accomplish that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Not willing, at the moment, to experience serious side
effects, More agility would be acceptable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Right now I'll trial anything to stop the progression to
improve my QoL as the last 2y have been shocking how fast things have
progressed. I do not hav sick time but am willing to give anything a trial if
means using holidays without pay right now. I just want to regain some basic
exercise, get this excessive weight off , improve my energy again &amp; feel
alive . Currently my future looks pretty bleak &amp; I'm still in shock with my
deteriorating physical health over the last 2y.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Being able to have a life balance with not so much pain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I was on Tremfy for a while, and during that time I needed
steroid shots in my shoulders. It wasn't the best for me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I would like to use a drug that does more for me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Enhanced - better sleep, less swelling in joints. Unmet
need - see above; side effects - possible if it enhances my lifestyle;
improvement -less pain and swilling less fatigue, better sleep. No other
benefits come to mind.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I am not willing to accept serious side effects with any
medication. Or it would have to guarantee putting my PsA into remission for me
to consider taking it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Enhanced quality of life is very important to me,
management is very important to me and would consider treatment if recommended
by my rheumatologist who knows me well from the past 20 plus years. Reduced
costs and the ability to not have to go to biosimilars would be wonderful. It
is difficult to measure the amount of improvement but less pain and having more
energy would be very helpful.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Experience With Drug Under Review</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two survey participants indicated that they have used
Tremfya (guselkumab). When asked what positive and/or negative effects they
experienced with this drug, the participants stated:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“80% clearer skin, much improved mobility, and range of
motion. No negative effects.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Nothing negative. Took longer for clearer skin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Demonstrating the heterogeneity of responses to treatment,
one participant thought that the drug treated their psoriasis better than their
arthritis. The other said that their skin was not as clear as on another
biologic, but that it helped the arthritis in their shoulders, though they are
not certain yet if they are experiencing PsA or osteoarthritis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both participants stated that they did not experience side
effects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When asked if this drug was easier to use than other
therapies they have tried, the two participants provided the following
insights:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Easier than some. Would be more convenient to inject at
home rather than make a doctor appointment and have to travel and take time off
work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Less injections. I get severe hangover after injecting any
biologic. Headache, feel off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both participants expect that this drug will change their
long-term health and well-being. Specifically, they shared that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I expect to live longer because life isn't as miserable as
it once was.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If it slows disease progression, that is good.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They shared examples of how Tremfya (guselkumab) is already
helping them achieve these outcomes. One participant reflected that there
is&nbsp;<i>“much less aggravation for myself and my family because I feel
better”</i>&nbsp;and the other shared that it has&nbsp;<i>“kept PsA from
getting worse.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Companion Diagnostic Test</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>N/A</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Anything Else?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like psoriasis, PsA is complicated, frustrating and can be
debilitating without access to appropriate treatments. Patients are very
different in how they react to changes in lifestyle, topical treatments, oral
treatments and biologics. What works for one patient may not work for the
other, even if their symptoms are very similar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For many, PsA is a disease that often “falls through the
cracks.” Some patients are seen by a dermatologist while others are seen by
rheumatologists. Joint pain is not always discussed with a dermatologist and
plaques on the skin are not always discussed with rheumatologists. These
challenges often lead to delays in diagnosis of PsA and consequently severe and
irreversible damage to the joints.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is still not clear how many people who have psoriasis
will get PsA. It is estimated that up to 30% of people with psoriasis will
develop PsA (estimates range from 4-30%, depending on what part of the world
you live in). Both diseases are caused by the immune system being
inappropriately activated. Most of the time (80%), psoriasis comes first but it
remains difficult to predict whether a person living with psoriasis will later
develop PsA, despite research advances that have identified several biomarkers
associated with PsA and advances in developing predictive screening tools.
(Eder, L. et al., The Prediction of Psoriatic Arthritis Tool (PRESTO) Study –
Interim Report, American College of Rheumatology Convergence 2020 conference,

<p class=MsoNormal>All patients are looking for a treatment that will control
all their symptoms but, ultimately, they would like a cure to this debilitating
disease. Earlier treatment of PsA can result in better outcomes and reduce the
risk of permanent and debilitating joint damage. PsA is also linked with an
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically atherosclerotic disease
(low grade inflammation in blood vessels). Controlling inflammation can reduce
the risk of PsA patients later developing heart disease. (Eder, L. et al.

<p class=MsoNormal><b>About Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance, Arthritis
Society, and CreakyJoints Canada</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance (CAPA) is a
grassroots, patient-driven and managed, independent, national education and
advocacy organization with members and supporters across Canada. CAPA creates
links between Canadians with arthritis, assists them to become more effective
advocates and seeks to improve the quality of life of all people living with
the disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CAPA believes the first expert on arthritis is the
individual who has the disease, as theirs is a unique perspective. We assist
members to become advocates not only for themselves but all people with
arthritis. CAPA welcomes all Canadians with arthritis and those who support
CAPA's goals to become members. Our website is updated regularly and can be
viewed at:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="http://www.arthritispatient.ca/">www.arthritispatient.ca</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Arthritis Society (AS) has been setting lives in motion
for over 70 years. Dedicated to a vision of living in a world where people are
free from the devastating affects that arthritis has on the lives of Canadians,
the Arthritis Society is Canada’s principal health charity providing education,
programs, and support to the over 6 million Canadians living with arthritis.
Since its founding in 1948, the Arthritis Society has been the largest
non&#8208;government funder of arthritis research in Canada, investing more
than $200 million in projects that have led to breakthroughs in the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of people with arthritis. The Arthritis Society is
accredited under Imagine Canada’s Standards Program. The website&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.arthritis.ca/">www.arthritis.ca</a>&nbsp;provides more
detailed information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For more than two decades, CreakyJoints has served as a
digital community for millions of arthritis patients and caregivers worldwide
who seek education, support, advocacy, and patient-centered research. All of
our programming and services are always provided free of charge. CreakyJoints
is part of the non-profit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ghlf.org/">Global Healthy
Living Foundation</a>, whose mission is to improve the quality of life for
people living with chronic illnesses. In keeping with our work at CreakyJoints
USA, CreakyJoints Canada inspires, empowers, and supports arthritis patients –
and patients living with other chronic conditions – and their caregivers to put
themselves at the center of their care by providing evidence-based education
and tools that help people make informed decisions about the daily and
long-term management of arthritis and other chronic conditions. At the heart of
CreakyJoints Canada is collaboration. We will continue and strengthen our work
with Canadian arthritis organizations and patient advocates that you know,
love, and respect. We are all stronger together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Information Gathering</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We developed a survey to hear directly from people living
with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) about their experiences with PsA and experiences
taking guselkumab (Tremfya). The survey was collaboratively developed by the
Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance (CAPA), the Arthritis Society, Canadian
Spondylitis Association (CSA), Canadian Association of Psoriasis Patients
(CAPP), CreakyJoints Canada, and Canadian Psoriasis Network (CPN). The design
was informed by the lived experiences of the organizations’ members, many of
whom live with various forms of arthritis. The survey was shared via e-mail,
social media, and organization websites from all five organizations, through
our respective Canadian networks and communities. The survey was open from
April 20, 2022, to May 16, 2022.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CAPA, CreakyJoints Canada, and the Arthritis Society are
making this collaborative submission, while the three remaining organizations
who collaborated on the survey design will each be making their own submissions
based on survey response data and their unique community perspectives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were 70 people that completed the survey with most
participants living in Ontario (49%) followed by British Columbia (17%),
Alberta (10%), Quebec (6%), New Brunswick (6%), Nova Scotia (6%), Newfoundland
and Labrador (4%) and Nova Scotia (4%). Under 15% of survey participants were
under the fifty years of age while the age range of the remaining survey
participants ranged from fifty to eighty-five. Two survey participants have
experience taking Tremfya. Four out of 5 people with psoriatic arthritis identified
as a woman and one out of 5 identified as men. Over 20% of participants
identified as living with a disability and about 70% of participants identified
as white. A low number (4%) of survey participants sleep in government or group
housing, 7% of survey participants rent housing while the remaining amount
(89%) own their current housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Disease Experience</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, inflammatory,
systemic disease of the skin and joints. Symptoms include musculoskeletal pain,
stiffness, fatigue, and limited range of motion in the joints as well as
psoriasis plaques that are itchy, sensitive, red, flaky and cause pain. PsA is
also a systemic disease meaning that other parts of the body in addition to
joints can be affected, including the eyes and heart, metabolic disease, and
related musculoskeletal diseases like osteoarthritis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I live with hypertension, depression, metabolic syndrome,
fibromyalgia, and the awful side effects of that, and Inflammatory bowel
disease.” Person living with Psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PsA can vary in severity from mild to very severe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Survey participants rated their disease severity as an
average of 57 out of 100. A person may experience active periods of disease
(commonly known as flares or flare-ups) and times where there is decreased
activity or even inactivity (remission). While people who have PsA live with
several symptoms, how they experience those symptoms and the severity of PsA
can be different from person to person – PsA is unique to each person who lives
with it. There is currently no cure for PsA. Survey participants indicated a
range of symptoms that are difficult to manage including joint stiffness (79%),
fatigue (75%), changes in fingernails and toes (63%), hip pain (61%), back pain
(51%), anxiety (47%), and stress (33%).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have to plan ahead to make sure I’m not scheduled for
anything on recovery day. I have to rest every afternoon or face the
consequences.” Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(I am) not well (and) in constant pain.” Person living with
psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People living with the disease are also at risk of
co-morbidities, such as depression and mental health issues, diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Periods of very active disease are called a ‘flare’ and for
some people, flares can be incapacitating. Flares are not predictable in terms
of how severe they will be or how long they will last. They may last for a few
hours, days, weeks or even months. Because of their unpredictability, flares
must be dealt with reactively by people. The unpredictable nature of PsA also
often makes it feel like a person is not in control of their disease and can
impact their ability to carry out day to day activities and life roles, such as
contributing to the workplace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I live very independently. The only difficulty I have is I
get tired more often and very occasionally have issues with my knees and
feet/ankles. Pain and swelling. Stairs can sometimes present an issue if it's
multiple stories. This happens after prolonged walking, standing or excessive
exercise.” Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The disease impacts all aspects of a person’s life including
a variety of activities that people without PsA take for granted such as
walking, sleeping, holding a phone, standing, and taking care of everyday
tasks, such as shopping, running errands, and cooking. Given the limitations in
activities of daily living, PsA impacts all aspects of a person’s life
including workplace participation and productivity, carrying out parenting and
other social roles, and relationships with spouses, friends, and family members.
When asked about the most significant impacts of PsA on their daily quality of
life, respondents expressed that PsA interfered with work (54%), social
connections (52%), self-esteem (50%), mental health (50%), intimacy (50%),
family life (38%) and friendships (24%). Other impacts included embarrassment
and self-consciousness from symptoms caused by PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(I don’t receive any support) at the moment per se but
spouse drives me to grocery store and helps pack bags, does washing of dishes
after I cook and bake. I do not qualify for other supports from my community at
the moment. Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People indicated difficulties in contributing and
participating at school or work due to the fatigue, pain, and other symptoms of
the psoriatic arthritis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People with psoriatic arthritis that completed the survey
indicated that they missed work due to their disease, including 28% missing 1-3
workdays per month, 17% missing 4-6 days per month, and 7% indicating they do
not work due to PsA. PsA impacts lives in many ways: daily tasks that many well
individuals take for granted may become too difficult or exhausting to
complete; participating in leisure activities or hobbies can be challenging;
while caring for or spending time with family members, including children,
spouses/partners, and other loved ones, also becomes difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I only work online with a modified work schedule. I’m not
able to do housework, exercise, socialize or travel like I used to.” Person
living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I take things day by day. I miss out on lots of things due
to pain and fatigue. I work shift work, usually 4 hrs per shift anymore, even
an hour, keeps me awake at night with agonizing foot and toe pain especially.”
Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PsA’s impacts also extend to others within a person’s
support circle, including caregivers such as spouses/partners and children who
provide valuable emotional and direct support in complete activities of daily
living. Often, these people take on additional chores or tasks such as cooking,
cleaning, shopping, etc. to support the person living with PsA, and family
roles change as spouses / partners take on more tasks, such as supporting their
spouses / partners in getting to and from medical appointments. They may
provide emotional support to help the person living with psoriatic arthritis in
navigating the health care system and the anxiety and stress of living with
PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Experiences With Currently Available Treatments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clinical practice guidelines emphasize early aggressive
treatment of PsA, which provides the best long-term outcomes for people living
with the disease. A number of treatment approaches are used to manage PsA
including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroids and
conventional synthetic Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic drugs (csDMARDS) such
as Methotrexate, as well as biologic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs
(bDMARDs), such as Etanercept and Infliximab. Effective treatments mean that
people with PsA do not need to live with the permanent damage, high medical
costs (e.g., surgery, mobility aids, accessible housing) and disability. Early
intervention is critical to allow people with Psoriatic Arthritis the
opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Spouse helps with errands, finances, cooking, cleaning.
Sister and father understand and provide emotional support. Friends do not
care.” Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(I tried) Chloroquine for my enthesis was ineffective - I
have not been offered other DMARDs as apparently, I don't qualify.” Person
living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notwithstanding the fact that numerous medication options
exist, patients’ responses to medication can vary significantly. Some
medications are effective for some people with inflammatory arthritis while not
effective for others. Survey participants indicated that they had experience
with many medications, such as Methotrexate (61%), Hydroxychloroquine (29%),
Sulfasalazine (32%), and Leflunomide (22%).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“My rheumatologist wasn’t seeing much improvement. Nor was
I. So, after a month trial of some we changed them.” Person living with
psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some treatments will only manage the disease for a short
period of time before the patient’s immune system adapts to a drug’s presence
(i.e., becomes non-responsive to it) and they will have to switch to another
medication. In some cases, patients with PsA may not adequately respond to any
of the DMARD’s (conventional and biological) currently available. A third of
survey participants noted that they had an inadequate response to currently
available treatments. As a result, patients need a number of medication options
in order to effectively manage their disease throughout their lives. There are
also no specific tests that identify which medication will be effective for a
person living with PsA. This means that a person with the disease will need to
go on one or more medications on a trial-and-error basis in order to find a
medication that is effective. Often, the treating physician determines which
medication is most appropriate based on a number of factors such as patient
preferences, mode of administration, anticipated side effects, etc. It is also
an anxious and stressful experience if medications are not effective and cost
thousands of dollars out of pocket. Oftentimes, people with PsA need to make
difficult financial choices in order to pay for their medications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is also important to note that conventional synthetic
DMARDs (csDMARDS) are difficult to take for people living with PsA. Nausea,
vomiting and a general malaise can persist for days after treatment with
csDMARDS. Due to these experiences, many patients may not wish to take the
medicine in question because the medication(s) is too difficult to take. This
impacts adherence to treatment, increases health care costs (e.g., more visits
to the doctor) and makes it difficult for people living with PsA to work, carry
out social roles and participate in other activities of daily living. Toxicity
issues (e.g., liver) can also be of concern for people taking csDMARDS, such as
Methotrexate, Immuran, and Leflunomide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I had terrible side effects. I just did not feel right.”
Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I discontinued methotrexate as I felt it was of no benefit
to me and has very harsh side effects.” Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patients may also pursue medical cannabis and/or
non-pharmacological approaches to manage PsA symptoms, such as physiotherapy,
occupational therapy, massage therapy, counselling, or acupuncture. These
approaches can often help to address the symptoms of the disease, such as pain
and fatigue. However, there are significant unmet patient needs in terms of
accessing non- pharmacological treatments, often because they are not
reimbursed through provincial health care systems, the treatment options are
simply not offered, or there are lengthy waits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patients identified many challenges in accessing treatment
options. Expense, travel, and time required for treatment were all cited as
being prohibitive. Some patients identified a difficulty in access to treatment
relating to lack of access to specialists and general practitioner, and/or the
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Survey participants accessed reimbursement of
medication costs in multiple ways, such as through private drug plans (57%),
provincial or federal government drug programs (21%) or disability support
programs (7%).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Improved Outcomes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PsA patients have identified several outcomes that are
important to them and that should be considered when evaluating new therapies,
including:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>route of drug administration (pills vs infusion vs
     self-injections)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>a reduction in pain and fatigue</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>effective for psoriasis symptoms as well as psoriatic
     arthritis symptoms.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>increased mobility</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>ability to work and be productive at work</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>ability to carry out activities of daily living</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>ability to effectively carry out parenting tasks and other
     important social roles</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>reduced infection rates</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>affordability of the medication</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>increased quality of life</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>improved sleep</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I would hope it works to alleviate fatigue.” Person living
with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Looking to get back to a regular exercise routine. That’s
my ultimate goal. Not as many stomach issues. Perhaps an easier time in the
mornings.” Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I have scar on lung. (I) don’t want infections either.”
Person living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Current medications for the treatment of PsA also have a
number of negative side effects, such as fatigue which often persists beyond 24
hours (Methotrexate), nausea (Methotrexate, Arava, Immuran), increased
infection risk (most DMARDs), liver toxicity and weight gain (Prednisone).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Hopeful I would qualify to as after 10 days on current
treatment (monthly injections) I go back to hardly being able to do daily tasks
or walk but I continuously push through. Would love to have that quality of
life and able to function and would absolutely accept side effects if less pain
and flares could happen. At this moment even a 15% improvement would be
amazing! This would help with less er visits, and in constant pain.” Person
living with psoriatic arthritis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Experience with Drug Under Review</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From those surveyed, two people identified having experience
with taking guselkumab (Tremfya). The respondents shared positive and negative
effects of taking guselkumab:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I had 80% clearer skin, much improved mobility, and range
of motion. No negative effects.” “Nothing negative. Took longer for clearer
skin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(It was) better at psoriasis than arthritis.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Overall, skin wasn't as clear as on another biologic, and
it's not ruled out if my shoulders have PsA or OA, so I cannot say that it did
not help for PsA in shoulders.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(It was) easier to take than some. (It) would be more
convenient to inject at home rather than make a doctor’s appointment and have
to travel and take time off work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(There were) less injections. I get severe hangover after
injecting any biologic. Headache, feel off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In terms of long-term benefits of taking the medication, the
two people noted the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“I expect to live longer because life isn't as miserable as
it once was.” “If it slows disease progression, that is good.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There was much less aggravation for myself and my family
because I feel better.” “(The medication) kept PsA from getting worse.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Information Gathering</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The information was gathered from a patient who submitted
their response via email on May 4, 2022 (Patient A) and patients who completed
ACE's patient input survey through SurveyMonkey from December 18, 2020 to
January 26, 2021 (Patients B to F).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Disease Experience</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How does the disease impact the patients’ day-to-day life
and quality of life?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has an unique and significant
effect on the lives of people living with it and they constantly consider the
state of their disease and decide what they can, or more likely, cannot, cope
with or achieve, how they can go about their daily lives, and how much help
they may need along the way. Because of the visible symptoms of the disease,
such as a scaly rash on the skin, patients also experience mental stress.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient A:</b>&nbsp;“I am in pain most of the time -
     day and night. It is not severe and not always constant, but staying too
     long in one position or certain moves trigger it. The pain is in my hands,
     mostly the wrists, one hip at the sacroiliac and sometimes the lower back.
     Due to the pain, I cannot enjoy long walks or many other activities which
     I used to do. It also affects my mood.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient B:</b>&nbsp;Living with PsA for 47 years and
     also has fibromyalgia and is living with obesity. “My psoriatic arthritis
     is under control because of the medication I take and my quality of life
     is very good as a result.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient C:</b>&nbsp;Living with PsA for 22 years. They
     have “restricted ability to walk distances, difficulty opening door knobs
     and lids on jars, and using cutlery for meals”. This patient experiences
     joint pain on a daily basis.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient D:</b>&nbsp;Living with PsA for 11 years. With
     medication therapies, they are able to control their PsA and maintain an
     active and busy life.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient E:</b>&nbsp;Living with PsA for 6 months. As a
     result of their PsA, they experience pain and reduced mobility function.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient F</b>&nbsp;was “diagnosed with PsA in 2015, but
     started to show symptoms in mid-eighties.” They experience pain in many
     joints and require 45 minutes warm-up exercises every morning before their
     day starts. They also experience big toes problems and have “psoriasis in
     scalp and on face” that requires lotions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How does the disease impact the caregivers’ day-to-day
life and quality of life?</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient A:</b>&nbsp;“My mood affects my family. Also, I
     will soon have a granddaughter&nbsp;and want to be able to take care of
     her and hold her without fear that my wrists will give out.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient B:</b>&nbsp;“Since I am not a caregiver, I
     cannot say what these may be.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient C, D, E:</b>&nbsp;N/A</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient F</b>: “None in my case.”</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Are there any aspects of the illness that are more
important to control than others?</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient A:</b>&nbsp;“I would like the pain to disappear
     permanently if possible.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient B:</b>&nbsp;“Joint damage from inflammation.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient C:</b>&nbsp;“Walking, using hands.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient D:</b>&nbsp;“Maintaining treatment schedule.
     Missing treatments, particularly my weekly methotrexate shot catches up
     with me…aches, stiffness, inflammation.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient E:</b>&nbsp;“Lack of mobility.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient F:</b>&nbsp;“Toes and psoriasis.”</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Experiences with Currently Available Treatments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How well are patients managing their disease/condition
with currently available treatments?</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient A:</b>&nbsp;“I have just started Methotrexate.
     It has only been a month. I notice no positive effects yet, but have some
     side effects which so far are not too bad. Though it seems to me the pain
     has increased since I started taking it. The side effects are headache,
     some bouts of nausea and I find I am not able to sleep as well. Folic
     tablets help with the nausea. I would have liked to have been put on
     biosimilars as apparently, they can lead to permanent remission in many
     cases if they are used early enough. Due to cost, I was put on
     Methotrexate, at least for the beginning. No problem in taking the pills.
     My lifestyle is not impacted.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient B</b>&nbsp;is currently taking Humira and
     methotrexate. “This is very effective in controlling my psoriatic
     arthritis. I have so far been lucky in that I haven’t experienced any
     adverse effects.” This patient has no hardships accessing Humira and
     methotrexate.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient C</b>&nbsp;is currently taking Erelzi,
     methotrexate, Plaquenil, Tylenol and ibuprofen and is not aware of any
     adverse effects. “All have moderate success.” This patient has no
     hardships accessing current therapies.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient D</b>&nbsp;is taking a combination of a
     Remicade infusion every 7 weeks and a weekly dose of methotrexate. They
     experience feeling of nausea for a couple days after methotrexate and
     higher level of fatigue all the time. When asked if there are any needs
     that are not met by current therapy, this patient stated: “Not for me to
     say – but many friends and relatives have asked about my treatments and
     their inability to access them or their acceptance of arthritis/pain as
     part of getting old.” This patient has no hardships in accessing current
     therapies; they added: “But I have private coverage for Remicade, which is
     roughly $3K every 7 weeks – roughly $21-25,000.”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient E</b>&nbsp;is controlling their psoriatic
     arthritis with medication and exercise; they state that both are not very
     useful and have no adverse effects. This patient would like warm water
     therapy to be available but this has stopped due to the pandemic.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient F:</b>&nbsp;“Exercise. Scalp lotion. Soak toes
     in yellow Listerine daily. Ointment on big toes twice a day. Skin cream on
     face once a day. Tylenol before heavy exercise. No therapy adverse
     effects.” When asked if there are any needs that are not met by current
     therapy, this patient stated: “Access to gyms and recreation centres.
     COVID-19 has closed gyms – tough for exercise issue.” This patient has
     trouble finding the time to exercise.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Improved Outcomes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section asked patients what they would consider when
choosing a therapy.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient A:</b>&nbsp;“I would like the pain to disappear
     permanently if possible. When on anti- inflammatory for 2 weeks at one
     point, I felt like a different person. My mood improved tremendously. I
     was happy. This is not the case when I have pain every day. Of course, my
     mood affects my family. Also, I will soon have a granddaughter&nbsp;and
     want to be able to take care of her and hold her without fear that my
     wrists will give out.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>All arthritis medications seem to have serious adverse
effects. Depending on how much they help with the disease, we are all willing
to make trade offs. So far with the Methotrexate, I do not see any improvement
so I am less willing to accept more side effects. If it improves the pain, then
of course that would make me more willing to tolerate the downsides.&quot;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient B:</b>&nbsp;“Potential side effects. In my
     case, how small an amount of these powerful drugs can be taken while still
     being effective (in order to minimize side effects).”</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient C:</b>&nbsp;Cost</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient D:</b>&nbsp;Side effects.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient E:</b>&nbsp;Investment of time when not really
     working.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patient F:</b>&nbsp;Avoid drugs.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Information Gathering</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Information was gathered through our clinical experience of
current products, knowledge of the existing literature, including results from
the published clinical trials, real-world studies, network meta-analysis and
presentation at the recent congress of guselkumab and other therapeutic agents
in PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Current Treatments and Treatment Goals</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>PsA arthritis is a complex disease with varied
manifestations. Broadly, therapy goals are to improve quality of life and
improve physical function by controlling joint pain and stiffness, clearing
concomitant psoriasis and extra-articular manifestations. Furthermore, our goal
is to limit structural damage and minimize long term complications arising from
inadequately controlled inflammation related to PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Canadian context, nonpharmacological treatment is
used as an adjunct rather than the sole form of therapy. In our experience,
less than fifteen percent of PsA patients are solely managed by
nonpharmacological therapies. These therapies include graded exercise programs,
structured physical and occupational therapy, diet, weight loss, and smoking
cessation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regarding pharmaceutical intervention, for mild articular
symptoms, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and local glucocorticoid
injections are implemented, and very infrequently, systemic steroids for a
limited period. For patients with persistent pain, stiffness, and swelling
despite NSAIDs, conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
are utilized, usually starting with either oral or subcutaneous weekly
methotrexate. Additional DMARDs used in combination or sequentially include
sulfasalazine and leflunomide. Hydroxychloroquine is used by Canadian
rheumatologist given its safety profile when used in combination with
methotrexate or leflunomide. Apremilast is usually reserved for traditional
DMARD failures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If two or more DMARDs are not effective after at least three
to six months at the optimal dose, then biologic agents or JAK inhibitors are
considered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The usual first-line biologic therapies include either TNF
inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol)
or IL-17A inhibitors (secukinumab, ixekizumab). IL-12/23 inhibitor
(ustekinumab) or JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) are usually
relegated to second-line therapies without contraindications to TNF inhibitors
or IL-17A inhibitors. All classes of biologics agents can be used after failure
to initial biologic treatment. If there is a primary failure to a particular mechanism
of action, strong consideration is given to a drug-using an alternate mechanism
of action. Prsence of specific extra-articualr manifestations need to be taken
into account when considering which medication to use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All approved treatments improve symptoms and can help reduce
concomitant steroid use. Therapies convincingly demonstrating disease
modification include TNF inhibitors, IL-17A inhibitors, tofacitinib and
upadacitinib.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Treatment Gaps (Unmet Needs)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Considering the treatment goals, please describe goals
(needs) that are not being met by currently available treatments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;There is still a significant unmet
need in the management of PsA. Limitations to current therapies include:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Current biologics only result in approximately 60% of
     patients achieving a good response (achieving ACR 20 response*)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Minimal disease activity (MDA*- a measure of a state of
     low disease activity) is achieved in approximately one in three to one in
     four PsA patients with biologic therapy</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Inability to sustain the reduction in joint inflammation
     results in either dose creep and/or secondary failure</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Persistence of active psoriasis despite improvement in MSK
     symptoms results in a sub-optimal response / poor quality of life for PsA
     patients.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Side effect profiles such as lupus-like syndromes or
     multiple sclerosis (with TNFi) and inflammatory bowel disease (IL-17A)
     limits the use of the two most common classes of biologics used to manage
     PsA (Humira monograph; Cosentyx monograph)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Current biologics are associated with a small but
     significant increased risk of serious infections (Jin Y et al, 2021, Li X
     et al, 2020)</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>(*ACR 20 and MDA are defined in the Appendix)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Place in Therapy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How would the drug under review fit into the current
treatment paradigm?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;Guselkumab is a fully human monoclonal
antibody that selectively inhibits the p19 subunit of IL&#8208; 23. This is of
direct relevance to psoriatic disease as the IL-23 cytokine pathway plays a
central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. Furthermore, IL-23 is
the key driver of Th17 cells and the downstream release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, and TNF. Furthermore, the
entheses contain a special resident T-cell population that reacts to localised
microdamage through IL-23 receptor to create a pro-inflammatory loop that
results in arthritis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The heterogenous nature of psoriatic disease necessitates
nuanced treatment considerations; precision medicine demands granular thinking
and should take into account the multiple facets of disease, disease state,
comorbidities and concomitant medications. Thus, consideration of these factors
that leads to the best treatment decision of advanced therapy in appropriate
patients. Thus in some patients IL-23 inhibition with guselkumab will be the
best option as a first line treatment. In other patients it may be a second
line option following intolerance to or inefficacy of other approaches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, based on the current clinical evidence, guselkumab can
be used as first-line biologic therapy (with or without traditional DMARDs) and
after TNF inhibitor failure (with or without conventional DMARDs). It
effectively treats all articular domains of PsA, and psoriasis and improves
fatigue and physical function, which are significantly compromised in the PsA
population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Which patients would be best suited for treatment with
the drug under review? Which patients would be least suitable for treatment
with the drug under review?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Which patients are most likely to respond to treatment
with drug under review?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;A broad range of patients with PsA
will improve with guselkumab treatment, including those with articular
inflammation, enthesitis, psoriasis, and axial disease. In particular,
psoriatic arthritis patients with moderate to severe arthritis and psoriasis
are the most likely to exhibit the best response, given the superior response
to cutaneous inflammation with guselkumab (Ritchlin C et al, 2021; McInnes I et
al, 2022; McGonagle D et al, 2021; Mease P et al, 2021)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Which patients are most in need of an intervention?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;Patients are refractory to current
therapeutic agents (TNFi, IL-17A, and JAKi) or those unable to take current
classes of biologic agents due to relative contraindications are most in keed
for an intervention. Additionally, patients with severe psoriasis, psoriatic
arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease would be good candidates, as well as
patients prone to infections as the serious infection rate with guselkumab in
the clinical trials was extremely low , with a serious infection rate of 1.2 to
1.7/100 PYs (Rahman P et al, 2021a). Our clinician group felt that guselkumab
is a very safe medication, and in fact, advances medicine and clinical
immunology beyond frankly immunosuppressive agents, which have largely
dominated the landscape, into the realm of more immunomodulatory approaches,
which optimizes disease control while minimizing adverse events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Would this differ based on any disease characteristics
(e.g., presence or absence of certain symptoms, stage of disease)?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;Guselkumab has demonstrated efficacy
compared to placebo regardless of sex, disease duration, various disease
characteristics, or disease severity (Ritchlin C et al, 2022)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How would patients best suited for treatment with drug
under review be identified (e.g., clinician examination/judgement, laboratory
tests (specify), diagnostic tools (specify)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response</b>: Patients suited for guselkumab can be
identified by rheumatologists due to inflammatory arthritis in the presence of
psoriasis. Articular symptoms can be measured and followed by tender and
swollen joint counts, active enthesitis, dactylitis or composite scores such as
psoriatic arthritis disease activity score (PASDAS), disease activity index for
psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA) or minimal disease activity (MDA).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Are there any issues related to diagnosis?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;Diagnosis of PsA is relatively
straightforward when assessed by a rheumatologist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Is a companion diagnostic test required?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;No companion diagnostic test that is
clinically actionable exists, and it is not required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Is it likely that misdiagnosis occurs in clinical
practice (e.g., underdiagnosis)?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;Rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, and erosive osteoarthritis can mimic PsA; however, this should not
be a problem for a rheumatologist under most circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Is it possible to identify those patients who are most
likely to exhibit a response to treatment with drug under review?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Patients with early disease and moderate to severe skin and
joint involvement are most likely to respond to guselkumab. That being said,
guselkumab can improve multiple domains of PsA and can be used broadly to
manage PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What outcomes are used to determine whether a patient is
responding to treatment in clinical practice? How often should treatment
response be assessed?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;Improvement in tender and swollen
joint counts, psoriasis, enthesitis, patient global, and ACR 20 are the most
common outcome measures used. Other composite measures include MDA, DAPSA and
PSDAS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What factors should be considered when deciding to
discontinue treatment with the drug under review?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;Ongoing inflammation characterized by
inflammatory pain/stiffness, (swollen or tender joint count), worsening
psoriasis, poor function, or intolerability due to side effects. Also, the
development of severe extra-articular manifestations that are not treated by
this medication, such as uveitis, may prompt a clinician to change to another
biologic that can treat pertinent manifestations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What settings are appropriate for treatment with [drug
under review]? Is a specialist required to diagnose, treat, and monitor
patients who might receive [drug under review]?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Response:</b>&nbsp;A rheumatologist or experienced nurse
practitioner with extensive rheumatology experience is needed to diagnose and
manage PsA confidently. This can be done in the community, outpatient clinic,
or specialty clinic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Additional Information</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psoriatic arthritis can involve multiple domains (joints,
enthesis, spine, skin, nails, and extra-articular manifestations such as
uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease) (Coates L et al., 2021). Over
two-thirds of PsA patients have simultaneous involvement of multiple domains
(Ogdie A et al., 2021). Currently, available treatments may either not treat
specific manifestations or only be mild/moderately effective (Coates L et al.,
2021). Guselkumab has been shown to be effective for the treatment of joints in
both naive and TNF inadequate responsive patients (McInnes et al., 2022; Coates
LC et al., 2022). It has also been shown to be highly effective for cutaneous
psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (Sandborn et al., 2022). Finally, it
does not seem to have an overlap with the same contraindications to therapy
that currently available biologics have (ie: drug induced lupus/multiple
sclerosis with TNF inhibitors (Humira Monograph) , IBD with IL-17 inhibitors
(Costentyx Monograph), shingles/CVD/malignancy risk with JAK inhibitors
(Xeljanz Monograph) and also has a very low risk of serious infections (lower
than placebo in both guselkumab and risankizumab trials (Guselkumab Monograph).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The highest priority for patients is pain relief (Gudu T et
al 2018). Patients treated with guselkumab reported twice the improvement in
patient pain, spinal pain, joint pain and bodily pain intensity by week 24
compared with the control group. These improvements were maintained or further
increased by week 52 and week 100 (Nash P et al, 2021). .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Up to 50% of patients with PsA report high levels of fatigue
and those patients place fatigue as the second or third domain of health in
terms of impact on their life and in terms of priority for improvement
(Reygaerts et al, 2018). When the effect of guselkumab on fatigue was
evaluated, it was demonstrated that patients with active PsA, guselkumab
100&#8201;mg q4w or q8w led to clinically meaningful and sustained improvements
in fatigue through 1&#8201;year (Rahman P et al, 2021b). A substantial portion
of the improvement in FACIT-Fatigue scores induced by guselkumab was
independent of effects on the achievement of other select outcomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conflict of Interest Declarations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To maintain the objectivity and credibility of the CADTH
