<p class=MsoNormal><b>Data</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the biologic-naive population, PASI response data were
available for nine active treatments (150&#8201;mg of SEC, 300&#8201;mg of SEC,
CZP, UST, GOL, ADA, INF, ETN and APR) from 13 trials<a

16 weeks were included in the analysis and assumed to be equivalent to outcomes

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of trial-specific data in the biologic-naive
subpopulation for PASI response outcome</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The NMA for PASI utilised a framework of analysis that
evaluated the probability of PASI responses in different categories of PASI
thresholds (50/75/90) within a single model:<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>117</sup></a>&nbsp;the
single model included all categories of PASI and generated a single effect
estimate for each treatment and also probabilities of achieving PASI 50, PASI
75 and PASI 90.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reflecting the analyses on PsARC, alternative assumptions
were tested in two analyses. The first analysis assumed independent treatment
effects and did not include any metaregression for placebo effects (model F1).
As the number of trials to inform each treatment effect was small, a
fixed-effect model was used. In a second analysis, we explored the impact on
treatment effects of adjusting for placebo responses [i.e. baseline effects
(metaregression model)]. As can be seen in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/table/table50/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 50</a><span style='font-style:normal'>, there were large
differences between trials for PASI responses in the placebo arms, ranging
between 0% (in IMPACT<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>51</sup></a>)
and 27% (in RAPID-PsA<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>47</sup></a>).
The IMPACT<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>51</sup></a>&nbsp;had
a very small sample size and reported 0% response in the placebo arm and 100%
response in the treatment arm, which lead to very extreme values for placebo
adjustment. Therefore, IMPACT<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458354/"><sup>51</sup></a>&nbsp;could
not be included in the metaregression analysis. Unlike the analysis for PsARC,
for PASI, we did not assume a class effect as the evidence from individual
trials does not support such an assumption.&nbsp;</span><a

<p class=MsoNormal>The results of models G1 and F1 are similar, except for a
small effect on the estimate of effect for INF; therefore, model F1 is the
preferred unadjusted model, as it does not exclude any trial evidence. In model
G2, the DIC and residual deviance are lower than in model G1, indicating that
the model fits well with the existing data and the data support the assumption
of adjustment with baseline effects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Network meta-analysis results of the PASI response:
probability of achieving PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90 in the biologic-naive
subpopulation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The results of the unadjusted NMA for the PASI, as a single
outcome or as separate categorical variables, show that all treatments are more
effective than placebo. The difference between treatments is uncertain, with
wide CrIs that mostly overlap with each other. The results show that patients
taking INF have the highest probability of achieving PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI
90 responses. However, after adjustment for placebo, 300&#8201;mg of SEC has
the highest probability of response. The probabilities for CZP changed between
the models. It appears to be less efficacious than all other treatments, except
APR and ETN, in achieving PASI responses in the unadjusted model. However, in
the adjusted model, it appears to be more efficacious than GOL, UST, APR and
ETN, and similar to ADA. The estimated probabilities from the analysis reflect
fairly closely those from the primary studies, indicating that the model fits
the data well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of trial-specific data in the biologic-naive
subpopulation for ACR response outcome</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As ACR is, like PASI, a categorical variable (ACR 20, ACR 50
and ACR 70), the NMA for ACR utilised a similar framework of analysis to that
used to estimate the probability of PASI responses: all categories of ACR were
within a single model which generated a single effect estimate for each
treatment and also probabilities of achieving an ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Analogously to the analyses on PsARC, sets of alternative
analyses were conducted for ACR response outcomes. We explored the effect of
differences in trial-specific placebo responses on treatment effect by
undertaking a metaregression. In the context of an adjusted model for placebo
response, we explored the possibility of there being class effects. Three
different class groupings were considered: all treatments as a single class;
all biologics as a class with APR separate; and, to reflect the pharmacology,
anti-TNFs grouped, ILs grouped and APR separate. In addition, we explored two
within-class assumptions: assuming treatments within a class to have equal
effectiveness and, alternatively, assuming that those treatments within a class
have similar (exchangeable) effectiveness. Fixed effects across studies were
assumed for all models. We have not considered models assuming exchangeability
between classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The placebo response-adjusted model I1 fits well compared
with the unadjusted model H1 (smaller DIC and residual deviance), but is not
significantly better. In addition, the results (rankings) generated by model I1
are very different from the observed trial results. Models J1, J2 and J3 do not
fit well with the existing data, resulting in a significantly higher residual
deviance and DIC. Both models K1 and K2 fit as well as the unadjusted model H1
(similar DIC and residual deviance).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among all the placebo response-adjusted models, models I1,
K1 and K2 show similar DIC and residual deviance, which means that these three
models fit the existing data equally well, although not significantly better
than the unadjusted model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The interaction term (beta) is negative in all models, which
means that higher placebo response rates in trials are associated with higher
treatment effects, demonstrating that adjustment for heterogeneity in the
placebo responses across trials was required. The interaction term varies
between models, but is similar between models K1 and K2.</p>

the other models and generates results that reflect the observed results.
Considering the placebo-adjusted models, model I1-generated results (rankings)
are very different from the observed trial results and the results generated by
model H1. Using an assumption of equal class effect for the treatments does not
produce a better-fitting model (models J1, J2, J3) than assuming independent
treatment effects (models H1, I1), or similar (exchangeable) treatment effects
(models K1, K2). In addition, there was a little difference in the
goodness-of-fit statistics (DIC and residual deviance) between models K1 and
K2, and we consider the exchangeable class effect model, which utilised two
classes (anti-ILs and anti-TNFs) with APR separate, to be the most clinically
plausible. Hence, our preferred models are models H1 and K2. Note that the
economic model uses PsARC; thus, these results were not implemented in the
economic model in&nbsp;<i><a

<p class=MsoNormal>Network meta-analysis results of ACR response: probability
of achieving ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses in a biologic-naive
subpopulation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The results of the unadjusted NMA for ACR, as a single
outcome or as separate categorical variables, show that all treatments are more
effective than placebo. The difference between treatments is uncertain, with
wide CrIs that mostly overlap with each other. The results show that patients
taking INF have the highest probability of achieving ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70
responses. The probabilities for SEC are lower than those for INF, ETN, GOL and
ADA. After adjustment for placebo, the probabilities for 300&#8201;mg of SEC
and 150&#8201;mg of SEC increase and are very similar to those for INF. The
probabilities of achieving ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses with CZP varied
between the models: in the unadjusted model the probabilities were higher than
only those for APR and UST, but after adjustment they were also higher than
those for GOL, ADA and UST.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the biologic-experienced population, trial-specific ACR
response data were available for three active treatments (300&#8201;mg of SEC,
CZP and UST) from three trials,<a

<p class=MsoNormal>The NMA model was similar to model H1: independent treatment
