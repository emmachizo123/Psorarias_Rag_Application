<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on the CADTH clinical review of the placebo-controlled
trials of guselkumab (DISCOVER-1, DISCOVER-2, and COSMOS), compared to placebo,
adults with active&nbsp;<b>psoriatic</b>&nbsp;arthritis (PsA) who received
guselkumab were more likely to show improvement as measured by the proportion
of patients who achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response,
the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and the
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). These responses were observed among
patients who were biologic-naive or had prior intolerance or inadequate
response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors. The indirect
evidence comparing guselkumab to other biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic
drug (DMARDs) available in Canada in the full population showed imprecise
results for ACR response rates, change in HAQ-DI scores, and risk of serious
adverse events (SAEs). This imprecision limits the ability to draw conclusions
from these data. Based on this indirect evidence, short-term PASI response
rates may favour guselkumab versus some biologics. However, there is
uncertainty in these findings, given that several sources of heterogeneity were
identified across the trials included in the sponsor-submitted indirect
treatment comparison and that is unclear whether the methods used to control
for potential bias were adequate. In addition, there was limited ability to
assess consistency between direct and indirect evidence. The biologic-naive
findings were consistent with the full population analysis. Due to the sparse
network for the biologic-experienced population, findings on all outcomes
(including PASI) are uncertain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH could not address all of the identified key
limitations in the sponsor’s economic submission. CADTH undertook reanalyses
that equalized discontinuation rates among biologic comparators; removed
double-counted resource use; removed apremilast as a comparator; and did not
consider the mixed-population analysis. These reanalyses indicated that
guselkumab is not cost-effective at the submitted price because it is dominated
by (i.e., it is more costly and less effective than) other available treatments
in both the biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations of adult
patients with active PsA. A price reduction of 20% (in the biologic-experienced
population) to 42% (in the biologic-naive population) is required for
guselkumab to enter the cost-effectiveness frontier, based on CADTH reanalyses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to the lack of available evidence, CADTH could not
assess the cost-effectiveness of guselkumab in the full population indicated by
Health Canada. CADTH analyses assumed differences between treatments in
clinical benefit; if no differences in clinical benefit are applied, different
price reductions may be required for guselkumab. The price reductions are based
on publicly available drug prices for the comparators. Further reduction may be
required if there are lower confidential prices for comparator products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Stakeholder Input Relevant to the Economic Review</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section is a summary of the feedback received from the
patient groups, registered clinicians, and drug plans that participated in the
CADTH review process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Input was received from 6 patient groups: Arthritis Consumer
Experts, the Canadian Association of Psoriasis Patients in partnership with the
Canadian Psoriasis Network, and the Canadian Arthritis Patient Alliance in
partnership with the Arthritis Society and CreakyJoints. Five of these
organizations (all except Arthritis Consumer Experts) collaborated by
developing survey questions using SurveyMonkey, and each organization shared
the surveys with its respective communities. There were 71 respondents to the joint
survey from across Canada, with almost half (34 respondents out of 71
respondents) being from Ontario. Additionally, Arthritis Consumer Experts
gathered information from 1 patient by email and from 5 patients through an
online survey. Patients reported nausea, vomiting, and general malaise with use
of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), as well as
concerns about toxicity, weight gain, and increased infection risk, all of
which decreased their willingness to use them. Biologic therapies were
associated with better efficacy (11 out of 20 responding patients considered
them to be “very effective” versus 9 out of 30 patients who said the same about
cDMARDs); however, some patients reported side effects that were difficult to
tolerate, loss of efficacy between administrations or over time, and concerns
about increased risk of malignancy. One-third of respondents noted that they
had experienced an inadequate response to currently available treatments,
whether conventional or biologic. Patients responding to the survey desired new
treatments to improve the management of their symptoms (pain, mobility,
fatigue, psoriasis), make side effects more tolerable, improve their quality of
life, provide improved routes of administration (i.e., infusion versus
self-injection versus oral pills), improve their ability to be productive and
carry out activities of daily living, and improve affordability. Some patients
reported that the cost of medications was a significant barrier to accessing
appropriate treatment, particularly given the lifetime maximums of some private
plans and the loss of private coverage when the disease was advanced enough to
interfere with full-time employment. Others reported difficulties accessing a
rheumatologist and the distance they were required to travel to visit 1. Two
respondents to the survey reported experience with guselkumab; 1 felt that it
treated their psoriasis better than it treated their arthritis, while the other
felt that their skin was not as clear as with other biologics, but that it
helped their arthritis. Both stated that they did not experience side effects.
One respondent reported that they had tried guselkumab and needed steroid
injections during treatment with it, stating “it wasn’t the best for me.” One
respondent emphasized that the subcutaneous administration of guselkumab and
the ability to inject it at home made it more convenient than therapies
requiring doctor appointments and time off work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clinical input was received from a group of 6
rheumatologists in Canada with an interest in PsA. The group noted that current
biologic therapies result in only 60% of patients (approximately) achieving an
ACR improvement of 20% (ACR 20), and that side effect profiles and
comorbidities limit the use of the 2 most common classes of biologics, the TNF
alpha and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) inhibitors. The group emphasized that the
heterogenous nature of&nbsp;<b>psoriatic</b>&nbsp;disease requires nuanced
treatment considerations, and that guselkumab, as an IL-23 inhibitor, may be a
good option for some patients as a first-line treatment with or without a
traditional DMARD, while in other patients, it may be a second-line option
following intolerance to or inefficacy of other therapies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH-participating drug plans noted the lack of
head-to-head trials comparing guselkumab to currently funded therapeutic
options and emphasized that with the availability of biosimilars for
adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab — and the patent expiration and current
testing of biosimilars for ustekinumab — newer drugs in this space would need
to prove more effective than available therapies to justify a price premium.
The drug plans indicated that prescribing criteria that were aligned with those
of other biologic drugs and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors would be preferred.
Concerns were raised regarding the budget impact of reimbursing guselkumab when
jurisdictional biosimilar initiatives are considered (i.e., removing originator
brands from funding where biosimilars are available).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several of these concerns were addressed in the sponsor’s
model:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Quality of life was incorporated.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients were
     considered separately.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The pharmacoeconomic analyses considered adalimumab,
     etanercept, and infliximab at the same cost as their biosimilar versions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, CADTH addressed some of these concerns as
follows:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>100% of adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab use was
     considered to be biosimilar in the budget impact reanalysis.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH was unable to address the following concerns raised
from stakeholder input:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>uncertainties in relative effectiveness compared to other
     biologics</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>the cost-effectiveness of guselkumab as a first-line
     therapy before or concurrent with cDMARDs, as mentioned by the clinician
     group.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Economic Review</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The current review is for guselkumab (Tremfya) for adults
with PsA in line with the DISCOVER-1, DISCOVER-2, and COSMOS trials. These
trials predominantly included patients who had experienced an inadequate
response to standard therapies (e.g., non-biologic DMARDs [non-bDMARDs],
apremilast, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Economic Evaluation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary of Sponsor’s Economic Evaluation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Overview</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Guselkumab is indicated for adults with PsA and can be used
alone or in combination with a cDMARD.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;The
sponsor’s reimbursement request is aligned with the indication.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;The
sponsor submitted 1 model that incorporated 3 cost-utility analyses assessing
the cost-effectiveness of guselkumab in 3 populations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of guselkumab
in all adult patients with PsA from the trials who had not responded to
standard therapies compared to 10 active treatments: TNF inhibitors
(adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, infliximab, and golimumab), IL-17
inhibitors (ixekizumab, secukinumab), IL-12/23 inhibitors (ustekinumab),
phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors (apremilast), JAK inhibitors
(upadacitinib), and best supportive care (BSC). This population differs
slightly from the Health Canada–approved indication; however, it aligns with
those in the guselkumab trials, in which patients had to have failed standard
therapy. As such, no cost-utility analysis was provided on the use of
guselkumab in adults with active PsA who had no prior therapies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of
guselkumab in a subpopulation of adult patients with PsA who had not previously
been treated with a bDMARD (i.e., were biologic-naive) compared to 9 active
treatments: TNF inhibitors (with the exception of certolizumab, which was
excluded due to a lack of data in this subpopulation), IL-17 inhibitors,
IL-12/23 inhibitors, phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and
BSC.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of
guselkumab in a subpopulation of adult patients with PsA who had previously
experienced an inadequate response or intolerance to at least 1 bDMARD (i.e.,
were biologic-experienced) compared to 5 treatments: IL-17 inhibitors, IL-12/23
inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and BSC.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;The
modelled populations in the sponsor’s analyses were based on pooled data from
the DISCOVER-1, DISCOVER-2, and COSMOS clinical trials.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>-</sup><a

lines of active therapies were not considered in these main analyses. BSC was

<p class=MsoNormal>Guselkumab is available as a 100 mg/mL solution for
injection in either a pre-filled syringe or a patient-controlled injector, with
a recommended dose of 100 mg at week 0 and week 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter.<a

submitted price of guselkumab is $3,059.74 per syringe or injector, which
corresponds to a cost of $21,418 per patient in the first year (52 weeks), and
$19,888 per patient per year thereafter (365 days).<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;The
annual maintenance cost of the comparator treatments in the sponsor’s model
ranged from $12,253 for adalimumab subsequent entry biologics (SEBs) to $21,716
for ixekizumab. Wastage of excess medication in vials was considered, where
applicable (i.e., for infliximab). BSC costs were captured as disease-related
costs rather than as drug-acquisition costs, and were based on disease
severity, as defined in the model inputs section that follows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clinical outcome of interest was quality-adjusted
life-years (QALYs). The sponsor adopted a lifetime time horizon (53 years),
with the analysis conducted from the perspective of a publicly funded health
care payer. Future costs and benefits were discounted at a rate of 1.5% per
year, and the model cycle length was 28 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Model Structure</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sponsor’s model took the form of a semi-Markov model
consisting of a trial period (i.e., an initial efficacy assessment period) and
a maintenance period (refer to&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/figure/tr8269861151140733_ch02_fig01/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Figure 1</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/#tr8269861151140733_ch02_a3">Appendix
3</a>). The trial period consisted of a series of tunnel states dependent on
the time point at which each therapy was assessed for response in its relevant
clinical trials (i.e., at 12 weeks for certolizumab, golimumab, infliximab, and
upadacitinib; at 16 weeks for apremilast; and at 24 weeks for guselkumab,
adalimumab, etanercept, ixekizumab, secukinumab, and ustekinumab). Patients who
achieved ACR 20 after the trial period entered the maintenance phase and
continued therapy until loss of response or an adverse event, then
discontinued. Patients who did not achieve ACR 20 discontinued their current
therapy at the end of the trial period and began treatment with the next line
of therapy. In the main analyses, this was a direct move to BSC as the final
line of therapy. The sponsor assumed that treatment type and status had no
effect on patient mortality. Risk of death was based on age- and gender-matched
all-cause mortality rates of the Canadian population,<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>7</sup></a>&nbsp;adjusted
for excess mortality due to having PsA.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Model Inputs</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The baseline population characteristics used to inform the
model were based on pooled data from the DISCOVER-1, DISCOVER-2, and COSMOS
trials,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>-</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>6</sup></a>&nbsp;which
included adults older than 18 years of age with active PsA and inadequate
response to standard therapies, defined as non-bDMARDs for more than 3 months,
and/or apremilast for more than 4 months, and/or NSAID therapy for more than 4
weeks. Baseline characteristics included starting age, percentage of patients
who were female, mean body weight, proportion of patients weighing more than
100 kg, and baseline HAQ-DI and PASI scores. These characteristics varied
slightly among the populations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sponsor submitted network meta-analyses (NMAs) that were
informed by the DISCOVER-1, DISCOVER-2, and COSMOS trials and relevant
comparator trials found in a systematic literature review for the population of
all included patients — as well as for biologic-naive and biologic-experienced
subpopulations — to assess the relative efficacy and safety of guselkumab
compared to other biologics for the short-term treatment of active PsA in
adults.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>9</sup></a>&nbsp;NMAs
were conducted for the outcomes of ACR response, PASI response, change in
HAQ-DI score, and SAEs. The best-fitting model (i.e., a baseline risk-adjusted
fixed-effect, baseline risk-adjusted random-effect, unadjusted fixed-effect, or
unadjusted random-effect model) was chosen for each analyzed population (i.e.,
biologic-naive, biologic-experienced, and mixed) and outcome (i.e., ACR 20
response, HAQ-DI score, PASI response, SAEs), with different models selected
across the populations and outcomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Response in the model was defined as achieving ACR 20 after
the trial period (12 weeks, 16 weeks, or 24 weeks) for each comparator; ACR 20
responders entered the maintenance phase of treatment, while non-responders
discontinued the drug and began BSC. Additional NMAs for change in HAQ-DI score
and PASI response were performed to estimate changes for both responders and
non-responders. Prior to response assessment (i.e., before the end of the
12-week to 24-week trial period), all patients were assumed to have baseline
HAQ-DI and PASI scores. After responders entered the maintenance phase, the
NMA-derived mean HAQ-DI score change from baseline for responders was applied,
as was a weighted average improvement in PASI score based on the distribution
of patients in PASI improvement categories (e.g., 75% improvement from baseline
in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score [PASI 75], 90% improvement from
baseline in PASI). This treatment effect was then assumed to be maintained for
the duration of therapy; loss of response was not explicitly modelled, but was
assumed to be captured through all-cause discontinuation. When patients moved
to BSC, HAQ-DI scores reverted to baseline and continued to worsen at a rate
equivalent to natural history progression (i.e., 0.072 per year) until
plateauing at the maximum value of 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Constant, annual, and treatment-specific discontinuation
rates were applied to each active treatment in the maintenance period. These
were based on weighted average 1-year discontinuation rates from the clinical
trials for each treatment.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Health state utilities were based on the York algorithm<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>10</sup></a>&nbsp;(i.e.,
utility&nbsp;= 0.897 to 0.298 ×&nbsp;HAQ-DI score – 0.004 ×&nbsp;PASI score).
Because HAQ-DI and PASI scores were assumed equivalent to baseline for the
duration of the trial period for each comparator, utility values were also the
same as at baseline for the duration of these trial periods (i.e., until
response assessment). Responders then entered the maintenance phase with
utility weights consistent with HAQ-DI and PASI scores calculated from mean
change from baseline scores for responders for each comparator, as determined
in the NMA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>SAE rates were based on probabilities reported by the
sponsor’s NMA for each comparator. SAEs were associated with a disutility of
–0.195, using serious infection to represent any SAE,<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>11</sup></a>&nbsp;and
applied for 12 days (the average duration of serious infections from the
DISCOVER 1 and 2 trials).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Costs included those for drug acquisition, treatment
administration, monitoring, arthritis- and psoriasis-related disease
management, and adverse events. Drug-acquisition costs for guselkumab were
based on the sponsor’s submitted price, while the costs of comparators were
based on Ontario, Saskatchewan, or Quebec formulary list prices.<a

not to oral or subcutaneous therapies. Resource usage, including rheumatology

model did not directly include drug costs for cDMARDs, given that these were

estimated health care costs from absolute PASI and HAQ-DI scores, which were
treatment-specific. The equation used to determine costs related to the HAQ-DI

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary of Sponsor’s Economic Evaluation Results</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sponsor submitted 3 probabilistic analyses intended to
represent the full Health Canada population (i.e., adults with active PsA), the
biologic-naive population (i.e., adults with active PsA who had not been
treated previously with a bDMARD), and the biologic-experienced population
(i.e., adults with active PsA who had been treated previously with a TNF
inhibitor). The sponsor’s probabilistic analyses were based on 2,000
iterations; the findings are presented here. The results of the deterministic analyses
were similar to those of the probabilistic analyses except where indicated. The
submitted analyses are based on publicly available list prices for the
comparators. Additional results from the sponsor’s economic evaluation are
presented in&nbsp;<a

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Base-Case Results</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among the full population of adult patients with active PsA
included in the trials (i.e., the mixed-population analysis), the sponsor’s
model predicted that there are 3 treatments on the cost-effectiveness frontier:
BSC, etanercept, and golimumab. Guselkumab was dominated by golimumab; i.e.,
guselkumab was more costly and less effective than golimumab (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/table/tr8269861151140733_ch02_t03/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 3</a>). This means that at the submitted price, guselkumab
would not be chosen as the optimal treatment strategy, regardless of a
decision-maker’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sponsor’s model predicted that guselkumab treatment of
adults with active PsA was associated with 7.82 QALYs and a cost of $304,881
over a lifetime time horizon; 97% of these QALYs were accrued after the trial
assessment point (24 weeks) on the basis of extrapolated long-term data. At a
WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY, guselkumab had a 4% chance of being the most
cost-effective therapy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the sponsor’s deterministic results, guselkumab was not
dominated; rather, it was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio (ICER) of $278,488 per QALY (i.e., 0.039 incremental QALYs and $10,826 in
incremental costs) relative to golimumab.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of the Sponsor’s Economic Evaluation Results for

<p class=MsoNormal>Among the biologic-naive population, 3 treatments are on the
cost-effectiveness frontier: BSC, etanercept, and guselkumab. Guselkumab was
associated with an ICER of $62,265 (incremental costs&nbsp;= $49,587;
incremental QALYs&nbsp;= 0.796) compared to etanercept (<a

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of the Sponsor’s Economic Evaluation Results for
Biologic-Naive Adults With PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among the biologic-experienced population of patients who
had previously failed 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors, 4 treatments are on the
cost-effectiveness frontier: BSC, secukinumab, guselkumab, and ixekizumab.
Guselkumab was associated with an ICER of $71,801 (incremental costs&nbsp;=
$19,086; incremental QALYs&nbsp;= 0.266) compared to secukinumab (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/table/tr8269861151140733_ch02_t05/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 5</a>). At a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the
sponsor’s model predicted a 21% probability of guselkumab being the most
cost-effective therapy. If a payer’s WTP threshold is $267,048 per QALY, then
ixekizumab becomes the optimal therapy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the sponsor’s deterministic analysis of this population,
the results were similar, with the exception that ixekizumab was dominated by
guselkumab: it remained more costly while accruing 6.451 QALYs (compared to the
6.456 QALYs accrued by guselkumab).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of the Sponsor’s Economic Evaluation Results for
Biologic-Experienced Adults With PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis Results</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sponsor also conducted scenario analyses. These included
assuming a&nbsp;<b>Psoriatic</b>&nbsp;Arthritis Response Criteria–based
responder definition, assuming a different utility algorithm, assuming an
average second-line (subsequent) therapy, considering lost productivity costs,
using a different source for long-term discontinuation, varying discount rates,
and using an NMA that incorporated COSMOS data using an analysis correcting for
early escape error (ACEEE) by ignoring the early escape treatment failure
criterion. Of these scenario analyses, those with the greatest impact on the
sequential ICER associated with guselkumab included changing the response
definition to a&nbsp;<b>Psoriatic</b>&nbsp;Arthritis Response Criteria response
(which increased the ICER for biologic-naive patients and decreased it for
biologic-experienced patients); including productivity costs (which decreased
the ICER for the biologic-naive population and caused guselkumab to fall off
the cost-effectiveness frontier for biologic-experienced patients); and
incorporating real-world psoriasis discontinuation data (which decreased the
ICER for both subpopulations).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>CADTH Appraisal of the Sponsor’s Economic Evaluation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH identified several key limitations to the sponsor’s
analysis that have notable implications for the economic analysis.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Relative treatment effects are uncertain:</b>&nbsp;The
     sponsor’s mixed population represents a combination of multiple patient
     populations studied in clinical trials (e.g., trials focusing on
     biologic-experienced patients, such as COSMOS; trials focusing on
     biologic-naive patients, such as DISCOVER-2; and trials that included a
     mixture of both types of patients, such as DISCOVER-1) that have been
     assessed in a single NMA. Combining these heterogenous patient populations
     into a single analysis leads to substantial uncertainty in the
     interpretation of the output used to inform the mixed-population analysis
     results. For example, prior exposure to biologics has been identified as
     an important effect modifier in psoriasis<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>23</sup></a>;
     thus, the inclusion of trials with biologic-naive, biologic-experienced,
     and mixed-experience patients in potentially different proportions between
     comparators increases uncertainty in results. As stated in CADTH’s
     Guidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Health Technologies,<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>24</sup></a>&nbsp;“when
     a stratified analysis is conducted […] the appropriate estimate of the
     overall result is determined by weighting the estimates for each subgroup
     by their respective prevalence.” The sponsor’s mixed-population analysis
     does not represent the cost-effectiveness of guselkumab in the full
     population of adults with active PsA in Canada because no such weighting
     of the 2 subgroups by prevalence was conducted.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH was unable to adjust for the uncertainty resulting
      from heterogeneity in the mixed population in its reanalyses; a
      prevalence-weighted combined analysis was not possible due to the
      different comparators included in the 2 subgroup analyses. CADTH reanalyses
      instead focused on the subgroup analyses for the biologic-naive and
      biologic-experienced populations of adults with active PsA. The
      cost-effectiveness of guselkumab in its full indicated population of
      adults with active PsA is unknown.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relative treatment effects in the model are derived from 4
sponsor-conducted NMAs comparing guselkumab to BSC and other biologics for the
outcomes of ACR 20 response, HAQ-DI improvement, PASI improvement, and SAEs.
The outputs of these NMAs suggests that guselkumab was ||||||||||||| ||||||
|||| ||||||| ||| ACR 20 response, change in HAQ-DI score, and change in PASI
score ||| ||| ||| ||||||||||||| ||||||||| || ||||||| ||| total SAEs. The NMAs
also suggest guselkumab may |||| || ||||||||| || ||||| || ||||||||| ||||||||
||||| |||||| |||||||| || ||| ||| ||| ||| ||||||||||, while indicating that

However, pairwise comparison between guselkumab and other active comparators
for these outcomes as well as for SAEs |||||||||| ||| |||| |||||| |||||||| |||
||||||||||| || ||||||||||| ||||||| || ||||| ||||||| || || |||||||||||. The NMAs
were associated with a number of limitations, including a lack of closed loops
allowing assessment of consistency among comparisons as well as heterogeneity
in the patient population for gender proportion, duration of PsA, number of
affected joints, proportion of patients with psoriasis affecting greater than
3% of their body surface area, and baseline PASI score. Only limited
information was available on the co-interventions received, patient
withdrawals, and imputation of missing data. In particular, the NMAs pooled
data from time points ranging from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. This range may bias
outcomes, especially those requiring a higher degree of improvement (e.g., 100%
improvement from baseline in PASI score versus PASI 75) in favour of
comparators that were studied for longer time periods (e.g., guselkumab). The
PASI outcome is also associated with a greater degree of uncertainty due to
wide credible intervals for some comparators, the assumption of similar
relative treatment effects across each response level, and the lack of
information on whether randomization was stratified by the presence of skin
lesions at baseline (i.e., the subgroup of patients analyzed for the outcome)
and whether groups were balanced for confounders. The indirect evidence was
limited to short-term outcomes and showed imprecise results for ACR response
rates, change in HAQ-DI, and risk of SAEs, limiting the ability to draw a
conclusion from the data. PASI response may favour guselkumab versus some
biologics, but it included the null for other comparisons, sometimes with wide
95% credible intervals, and was associated with uncertainty. The findings in
the subgroup of patients who were biologic-naive were generally similar to
those for the overall population in the sponsor-submitted NMA. The NMAs in the
biologic-experienced population were sparse and showed greater imprecision in
their results.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH was unable to adequately address the uncertainty
      associated with the point estimates derived from the sponsor’s NMA.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the sponsor considered cDMARDs to be captured
within BSC, there is no analysis comparing the clinical efficacy of guselkumab
to that of cDMARDs. The clinical trials of guselkumab allowed for the use of
cDMARDs concomitantly with either treatment. Thus, the sponsor has incorporated
cDMARD costs within BSC without fully assessing the relative effects of
guselkumab compared with cDMARDs.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH was unable to assess the relative effectiveness of
      guselkumab compared with cDMARDs.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Long-term treatment efficacy is uncertain</b>: The
     sponsor’s model is based on an NMA comparing treatment efficacy over the
     short-term (12 weeks to 24 weeks). It assumes that patients who respond to
     and continue on their biologic therapy will continue receiving the full
     benefit of that treatment for as long as they remain on therapy. This
     implicitly assumes that treatment waning does not occur for the modelled
     outcomes (i.e., HAQ-DI and PASI). The sponsor assumed no attenuation of
     efficacy while on treatment.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH could not address this limitation in its
      reanalyses. The impact of this limitation on the results is unclear.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Long-term discontinuation is uncertain and based on a
     naive comparison:</b>&nbsp;The sponsor’s model used treatment-specific
     long-term discontinuation rates (i.e., discontinuation after ACR 20
     response has been established) for all comparators except BSC, based on
     the rates observed in the clinical trials for each comparator.<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;By
     using discontinuation rates directly from each comparator’s clinical
     trials, the model naively compares trial results without consideration for
     between-trial heterogeneity in patient populations, trial design,
     concurrent therapies, subsequent therapies, or time point of response
     assessment. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that differential
     discontinuation rates would exist in the same population of patients in
     Canadian clinical practice. Furthermore, modelled patients experienced only
     1 line of therapy before transitioning to BSC; therefore, they would
     experience worsening of their disease (and the associated QALY loss and
     cost increase thereafter) to a degree that would not occur in Canadian
     clinical practice; meanwhile, patients who discontinued would transition
     to another biologic and gain the associated QALY benefit and avoid greater
     disease-related costs. Therefore, the sponsor’s included differences in
     discontinuation rates have an implausibly large impact on the results and
     are the largest driver of the model.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH reanalyses incorporated a long-term discontinuation
      rate of 16.5% per year for all active comparators, consistent with the
      rate used in previous models for PsA.<a

 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Disease-related costs are uncertain and may double
     count some resource use</b>: Disease-related costs in the model were based

     method assumes that the cost of treating a patient with PsA, excluding
     biologic therapies, is the same as the cost of treating a patient with
     rheumatoid arthritis plus the cost of treating a patient with psoriasis;
     however, this is unlikely to be the case because some aspects of patient
     care would overlap for patients with PsA, such as pain control,
     hospitalizations, and community care. Additionally, some aspects of care
     included in the algorithms are costed separately within the model, such as
     health care provider visits and laboratory tests.<a

     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>22</sup></a>&nbsp;Also,
     given the availability of both cDMARDs and bDMARDs in recent years
     (representing better treatment), it is unlikely that resource use is as
     closely correlated to disease severity as it was in previous years. It is
     also unlikely that European resource use in the 1980s and 1990s adequately
     approximates current Canadian practice. Finally, the assumption that
     modelled patients discontinue their initial bDMARD and continue on BSC for
     their remaining years further inflates disease-related costs beyond that which
     would actually be seen in practice.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH reanalyses removed the separate resource-use costs
      in the model on the basis that these costs are already included in the
      disease-related cost algorithms. CADTH explored the uncertainty in the
      disease-related cost algorithms by halving the HAQ-DI–based coefficient
      and the difference in costs between mild to moderate psoriasis and
      moderate to severe psoriasis in a scenario analysis.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Treatments modelled were not reflective of current
     Canadian clinical practice:</b>&nbsp;Apremilast received a conditional
     positive recommendation from CADTH for the treatment of PsA<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>27</sup></a>; as
     a result, it was included in the sponsor’s main analyses. However, because
     negotiations have twice concluded without an agreement with the
     pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, apremilast is not currently listed
     for reimbursement by public drug programs.<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>28</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>29</sup></a>&nbsp;Additionally,
     because the guselkumab trials included patients who had failed at least 1
     standard therapy that could include apremilast, it may not be appropriate
     to consider apremilast in patients’ next line of therapy.<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>3</sup></a><sup>-</sup><a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>5</sup></a>&nbsp;CADTH
     also noted that the limited list of comparators in the
     biologic-experienced population did not reflect the treatments used in
     clinical practice. The sponsor stated that this was due to a lack of trial
     data for other available treatments in this line of therapy.<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH also noted that, based on the Health Canada indication
for guselkumab,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;patients
are not required to have failed any previous therapies. However, the included
clinical trials required patients to have previously failed at least 1 prior
therapy, which could include a cDMARD, apremilast, and/or an NSAID. Therefore,
the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of guselkumab in patients who have
received no previous therapies is unknown. Additionally, bDMARDs in Canada are
typically reimbursed only if a patient has previously failed at least 2 cDMARDs
(e.g., Ontario,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>30</sup></a>&nbsp;Saskatchewan<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>31</sup></a>). Given
that all comparators in the sponsor’s submitted analysis are bDMARDs (except
for BSC), CADTH considered BSC to be the only relevant comparator for patients
who have failed only 1 prior cDMARD. This consideration aligns with clinical
practice and current reimbursement criteria. However, data informing the
efficacy of guselkumab and BSC were not available for this subgroup.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH removed apremilast as a comparator from the
      biologic-naive population analysis. Due to a lack of data, CADTH was
      unable to explore the cost-effectiveness of guselkumab in patients who
      had not failed at least 1 standard therapy, nor in patients who had
      failed only a single cDMARD.</li>

</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, the following key assumptions were made by the
sponsor and have been appraised by CADTH (refer to&nbsp;<a

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Base-Case Results</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The CADTH main reanalyses were derived by making changes to
model parameter values and assumptions in consultation with clinical experts.
CADTH did not consider the sponsor’s mixed-population analysis due to
limitations with the sponsor’s approach. Thus, CADTH focused on the
biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations individually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The CADTH reanalyses addressed some key limitations of the
submitted economic model by equalizing long-term discontinuation among
comparators, removing the double-counted resource-use costs, and removing
apremilast from the biologic-naive analysis (<a

<p class=MsoNormal>Among patients who are biologic-naive, 3 treatments were on
the cost-effectiveness frontier (BSC, etanercept, and infliximab); however,
guselkumab was dominated by numerous biologic therapies because it was more
costly and less effective (refer to&nbsp;<a

treatments were also on the cost-effectiveness frontier (in this case, these
were BSC, secukinumab, and ixekizumab); however, guselkumab was dominated by
secukinumab and upadacitinib (refer to&nbsp;<a

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of the CADTH Reanalysis Results for
Biologic-Experienced Adults With PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Scenario Analysis Results</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scenario analyses were conducted using the main CADTH
reanalyses for both the biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations to
investigate the impact of halving the disease-related cost differences
associated with worsening HAQ-DI scores and psoriasis severity and increasing
the standardized mortality rate of 1.34 for patients with PsA relative to the
general population. Guselkumab remained dominated in both populations. Details
and results of these scenarios are presented in&nbsp;<a

target=object>Table 22</a>, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH also undertook price reduction analyses based on the
sponsor-submitted analyses for the biologic-naive and biologic-experienced
populations as well as for the CADTH main reanalyses of the same populations.
For patients with active PsA who are naive to biologics, a 42% price reduction
would be required for guselkumab to be considered the most cost-effective
option at a WTP threshold of $50,000 per QALY (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/table/tr8269861151140733_ch02_t23/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 23</a>), while a 20% price reduction would be required when
considering patients with active PsA who are biologic-experienced (<a

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Issues for Consideration</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Availability of risankizumab for this population is
     unclear</b>: Risankizumab (Skyrizi), an IL-23 inhibitor, has a Health
     Canada indication for PsA that is identical to that of Tremfya.<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp;Risankizumab
     is reimbursed by public plans for plaque psoriasis<a

     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>14</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>34</sup></a>;
     however, it has not been reviewed by CADTH for the treatment of PsA. At
     the list price of the 150 mg dose on the Saskatchewan formulary, the
     annual maintenance cost of risankizumab for PsA would be $21,458 per
     patient per year. This is more expensive than most other bDMARDs available
     for the treatment of PsA, including guselkumab at its submitted price.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The analysis is based on publicly available prices for
     comparators</b>: The modelled prices of biologic therapies are based on
     publicly accessible list prices and do not reflect existing confidential
     pricing that has been negotiated by public plans. When existing
     confidential discounts on biologic therapies are considered, greater price
     reductions than those estimated in this report would be required to
     achieve cost-effectiveness.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Guselkumab was not successfully negotiated for
     reimbursement for the treatment of plaque psoriasis</b>: In 2018, the
     CADTH Canadian Drug Expert Committee recommended that guselkumab be funded
     for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in a similar
     manner to other biologic therapies, with the condition that the drug plan
     cost for guselkumab should not exceed the drug plan cost of treatment with
     the least costly biologic reimbursed for moderate to severe plaque
     psoriasis.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>35</sup></a>&nbsp;However,
     in 2019, price negotiations between the sponsor and the pan-Canadian
     Pharmaceutical Alliance concluded without an agreement. As a result,
     guselkumab is not currently listed for the treatment of plaque psoriasis
     by public drug plans in Canada.<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>36</sup></a></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Patents for some comparators have recently expired:</b>&nbsp;The
     patents for ustekinumab and certolizumab expired in June 2021 and August
     2021, respectively.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>37</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>38</sup></a>&nbsp;As
     such, it is possible that biosimilar versions of 1 or both products could
     become available within the next few years. Should this happen, the
     incremental cost of guselkumab compared to ustekinumab and/or certolizumab
     would increase.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The dosing regimen of guselkumab may be preferred by
     some patients</b>: The recommended maintenance dose schedule for
     guselkumab is every 8 weeks,<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>1</sup></a>&nbsp;which
     is a longer interval than most of the comparator bDMARDs (the exceptions
     are ustekinumab, which is dosed every 12 weeks in the maintenance phase,
     and infliximab, which involves an infusion every 8 weeks; refer to&nbsp;<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/#tr8269861151140733_ch02_a1">Appendix
     1</a>). It is likely that some patients will prefer less frequent
     injections. These patients may prefer options such as guselkumab.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Overall Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on the CADTH clinical review of the DISCOVER-1,
DISCOVER-2, and COSMOS clinical trials, compared to placebo, adults with active
PsA who received guselkumab were more likely to show improvements in terms of
ACR response, HAQ-DI improvement, and — in patients with psoriasis affecting 3%
or more of their body surface area at baseline — PASI response. Favourable
clinical responses were observed among patients who were biologic-naive, among
patients who had experienced prior intolerance or inadequate response to TNF
alpha inhibitors, and among a mixed population that included patients with and
without prior TNF inhibitor exposure. There is no direct evidence comparing
guselkumab to other biologic DMARDs available in Canada. The indirect evidence
comparing guselkumab to other biologic DMARDs available in Canada in the full
population showed imprecise results for ACR response rates, change in HAQ-DI
scores, and risk of SAEs. This imprecision limits the ability to draw
conclusions from these data. Based on this indirect evidence, short-term PASI
response rates may favour guselkumab versus some biologics. However, there is
uncertainty in these findings, given that several sources of heterogeneity were
identified across the trials included in the sponsor-submitted indirect
treatment comparison and that it is unclear whether the methods used to control
for potential bias were adequate. In addition, there was limited ability to
assess consistency between the direct and indirect evidence. The findings for
the biologic-naive population were consistent with those for the full
population in the analyses. Due to the sparse network for the
biologic-experienced population, findings on all outcomes (including PASI) are
uncertain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH identified several key limitations with the sponsor’s
economic submission. First, the relative clinical effectiveness of guselkumab
compared to other biologics is uncertain because the sponsor’s mixed-population
analysis combined the heterogenous subpopulations of biologic-naive and
biologic-experienced patients into 1 analysis without consideration for the
prevalence of the 2 subpopulations in Canadian practice or the proportions of
each subpopulation in the included trials of different comparators. Additionally,
the relative clinical effectiveness of guselkumab compared to other biologic
comparators is uncertain as the sponsor’s NMA is associated with limitations
and must be interpreted with caution, given the imprecision in the point
estimates. Second, the trial evidence is short-term (12 weeks to 24 weeks);
long-term outcomes have not been assessed in the clinical trials. Third, the
sponsor naively compared discontinuation rates from individual trials for each
comparator without regard to heterogeneity in patient populations and trial
design. When combined with the assumption that patients would discontinue
directly to BSC, this approach amplified differences in the QALYs gained and
costs derived from these discontinuation differences. Fourth, disease-related
resource use was uncertain; therefore, it was likely double counted. Finally,
the modelled treatments were not reflective of current Canadian practice;
apremilast is not currently reimbursed by public dug plans, and the comparators
considered in the biologic-experienced population may be too limited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH undertook reanalyses that equalized the
discontinuation rates between biologic comparators, removed some double-counted
resource use, removed apremilast, and did not consider the mixed-population
analysis. These reanalyses indicated that guselkumab is not cost-effective at
the submitted price because it is dominated by (i.e., it is more costly and
less effective than) other available treatments in both the biologic-naive and
biologic-experienced populations of adult patients with active PsA. A price reduction
of 20% (in the biologic-experienced population) to 42% (in the biologic-naive
population) is required for guselkumab to move onto the cost-effectiveness
frontier, based on CADTH reanalyses. However, CADTH was unable to address all
limitations, including uncertainty in the relative short- and long-term
clinical effectiveness of guselkumab; the unknown cost-effectiveness of
guselkumab against excluded comparators; and the lack of cost-effectiveness
information for the full population of patients indicated by Health Canada. The
CADTH reanalysis assumed differences between treatments in clinical benefit
based on the point estimates from the NMAs; if no differences in clinical
benefit are applied, then different price reductions may be required for guselkumab.
The price reductions are based on publicly available drug prices for the
comparators. Further reduction may be required if confidential discounts exist
for comparator products.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary of Sponsor’s Budget Impact Analysis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the submitted budget impact analysis (BIA), the sponsor
assessed the introduction of guselkumab for patients with active PsA who
require a biologic or advanced therapy. The BIA was undertaken from the
perspective of a Canadian public payer over a 3-year time horizon (2023 to
2025) using an epidemiological approach. The sponsor’s analysis included
drug-acquisition costs; dispensing fees and markups were not included in the
base case. Data from the model were obtained from various sources including Statistics

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of Key Model Parameters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary of the Sponsor’s BIA Results</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Results of the sponsor’s analysis suggest that the
reimbursement of guselkumab for adults with PsA will be associated with an
incremental cost of $444,327 in year 1, $587,636 in year 2, and $927,602 in
year 3, for a 3-year total incremental budgetary impact of $1,959,564.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a scenario where all adalimumab, etanercept, and
infliximab use is assumed to be biosimilars, the reimbursement of guselkumab
would be associated with an incremental cost of $1,040,621 in year 1,
$1,413,112 in year 2, and $2,228,814 in year 3, for a 3-year total incremental
budget impact of $4,682,546.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>CADTH Appraisal of the Sponsor’s BIA</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH identified several key limitations to the sponsor’s
analysis that have notable implications on the results of the BIA:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Analysis assumes guselkumab will not grow the biologic
     market:</b>&nbsp;The sponsor’s analysis assumes that patients will only
     receive guselkumab if they would otherwise have received a different
     biologic therapy. The sponsor is therefore implicitly assuming that
     guselkumab will not be reimbursed for its full indication of adults with
     active PsA, but instead will be reimbursed in a manner similar to other
     biologic drugs currently reimbursed by public drug plans. Should
     guselkumab instead be reimbursed under criteria which are less strict than
     existing biologic therapies, the budget impact of such reimbursement would
     be substantially larger than estimated.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH was unable to estimate the budget impact of
      reimbursing guselkumab for its full indication due to a lack of data on
      how much the market would expand and hard-coding of market shares within
      the model making adjustments impractical. Under such an assumption, the
      budget impact of reimbursing guselkumab would be substantially larger
      than that estimated by either the sponsor’s or CADTH’s base case.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Proportion of patients using biologics is uncertain:</b>&nbsp;The
     sponsor estimated that the proportion of patients with PsA who have active
     disease and would use a biologic therapy was 62%, based on 2012/2013 data
     from a retrospective cohort study of US registry data.<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>42</sup></a>&nbsp;It
     is unlikely that overall US biologic use can be generalized to current
     Canadian practice, nor to the proportion of publicly reimbursed patients
     who will receive a biologic within the next 3 years. The expert consulted
     by CADTH estimated that biologic use by publicly reimbursed patients with
     PsA is likely lower than estimated by the sponsor due to reimbursement
     criteria implemented by public plans but was unable to provide a precise
     estimate.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH could not adjust for this limitation in its
      base-case analysis. A scenario analysis was conducted exploring the
      impact of assuming only 50% of publicly reimbursed patients with PsA in
      Canada are using a biologic.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market uptake and displacement uncertain:</b>&nbsp;The
     sponsor based the proportion of the market guselkumab would take as well
     as the proportions of other comparators displaced on those submitted to
     and estimated by CADTH for the review of upadacitinib for PsA, with uptake
     in years 2 and 3 halved from that of upadacitinib, as the latter drug was
     expected to benefit from a patient preference for oral therapies which
     would not apply to guselkumab. The clinical expert consulted by CADTH
     considered the uptake estimates to be reasonable, but noted that the perceived
     benefit of guselkumab for psoriasis symptoms and the lack of association
     with irritable bowel disease symptoms that may be experienced with some
     comparators (e.g., secukinumab, ixekizumab), may lead to increased uptake
     of guselkumab relative to other biologic options. However, the sponsor’s
     model as programmed was not capable of estimating increased market share
     for guselkumab while also assuming 100% biosimilar use.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH was unable to formally explore different guselkumab
      uptake scenarios around its base case due to limitations in the way the
      sponsor’s model was programmed. However, if uptake for guselkumab is
      assumed to be double that predicted, the estimated budget impact of
      reimbursing guselkumab would also be doubled.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Biosimilar use is underestimated</b>: The sponsor’s
     base case assumes that the majority of patients on adalimumab, etanercept,
     and infliximab are using the originator products, citing internally
     conducted market forecasts. However, public drug plans have instituted or
     are planning to institute policies limiting reimbursement of biologic
     products to less expensive SEBs where available. As such, it is expected
     that publicly funded SEB use will increase and therefore become the most
     relevant comparator for new entries into affected therapeutic spaces.
     Additionally, the CUA submitted by the sponsor assumes 100% biosimilar use
     for adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, therefore the BIA should also
     do so to ensure consistency between the analyses. Finally, the patents for
     ustekinumab and certolizumab recently expired, making it possible for
     biosimilar versions to become available within the 3-year time frame of
     the BIA. However, assuming the sponsor’s estimates of the market share and
     expected displacement of ustekinumab and certolizumab, this is not
     expected to have a large effect on the projected budget impact of
     guselkumab.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH reanalyses assumed that all use of adalimumab,
      etanercept, and infliximab is SEB products.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The adult non-insured health benefits</b>&nbsp;(<b>NIHB)
     population was inaccurately estimated:</b>&nbsp;The sponsor’s BIA for the
     NIHB population did not limit the population to clients older than 18
     years of age, and therefore did not reflect the Health Canada indication
     for guselkumab which is limited to adults with active PsA. Additionally,
     adults residing within the borders of Ontario who are older than 65 years
     of age are reimbursed under the ODB program first, rather than NIHB, and
     therefore NIHB clients in Ontario who are older than 65 should be
     considered part of the Ontario population for the purpose of the BIA.
     Finally, the sponsor’s pan-Canadian analysis considers the full population
     of Canada and subtracts the populations of Quebec and the territories,
     however this fails to account for the NIHB population residing within
     Quebec and the territories who, as clients of a CDR-participating plan,
     should be counted within the pan-Canadian population.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH considered only the adult NIHB population in
      reanalyses and moved patients older than 65 years of age who reside
      within the borders of Ontario from the NIHB population to the ODB
      population. The pan-Canadian population was calculated by adding the eligible
      non-NIHB adult provincial populations<a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>39</sup></a>&nbsp;except
      Quebec to the adult NIHB population<a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/"><sup>44</sup></a>&nbsp;rather
      than subtracting the populations of Quebec and the territories from the
      total population of Canada.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Induction year assumption is inappropriate</b>: The
     sponsor’s analysis assumes that every patient initiates treatment with
     their assigned biologic in year 1, continuing into the maintenance phase
     of treatment in years 2 and 3. However, as the model uses prevalence data
     to calculate population size, it should be assumed that patients with PsA
     existing in the base year would already be using a biologic, and only
     those who initiated biologic therapy (i.e., new patients) or those who
     switched therapies would be in an induction phase in any year of the model.
     The CADTH CUA reanalyses assume that 16.5% of patients will discontinue
     their biologic therapy per year, therefore it follows that 16.5% of
     patients within the BIA who were on biologic therapy the previous year
     would be in an induction year, while 100% of new patients would be. As
     guselkumab is not available in the base year of the analysis, all
     guselkumab patients in year 1 would be in an induction year.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>CADTH reanalyses assumed that 100% of incident patients
      (patients not in the model the previous year) would be in an induction
      year, regardless of biologic therapy, while 16.5% of patients continuing
      from a previous year (prevalent patients) would be in an induction year
      to represent those in the process of switching therapies. 100% of
      guselkumab patents in year 1 were assumed to be in an induction year,
      dropping to 16.5% of pre-existing patients in years 2 and 3.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>CADTH Reanalyses of the BIA</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH revised the sponsor’s submitted analysis by assuming
100% SEB use for products where they were available, correcting the NIHB
population estimates, and assuming that 100% of incident (new) patients and
16.5% of prevalent patients (pre-existing) were in an induction phase of their
biologic during each year of the model. The changes made to derive the CADTH
base case are described in&nbsp;<a

<p class=MsoNormal>Summary of the CADTH Reanalyses of the BIA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>CADTH conducted additional scenario analyses (<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK601784/table/tr8269861151140733_ch02_t29/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 29</a>) to highlight the uncertainty associated with the
potential budget impact. Scenarios were conducted assuming: a lower proportion
of patients with PsA are assumed to require a biologic/advanced therapy, a
price reduction of 20% consistent with that estimated by the CADTH CUA
reanalysis for the biologic-naive population, and a 42% price reduction
consistent with that estimated by the CADTH CUA reanalysis for the
biologic-experienced population. While CADTH was unable to formally explore a
scenario with increased guselkumab uptake due to limitations in the programming
of the sponsor’s model, if guselkumab uptake was assumed to be double that
predicted, the resulting budgetary impact would also be doubled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All analyses assume that guselkumab will be used only in
patients who would otherwise receive an alternate biologic. Should guselkumab
be reimbursed with broader reimbursement criteria than that of other reimbursed
biologics, the associated budget impact would be substantially higher.</p>
