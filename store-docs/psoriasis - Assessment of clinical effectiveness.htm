<p class=MsoNormal><b>Chapter 3Assessment of clinical effectiveness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This report contains reference to confidential information
provided as part of the NICE appraisal process. This information has been
removed from the report and the results, discussions and conclusions of the
report do not include the confidential information. These sections are clearly
marked in the report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods for reviewing clinical effectiveness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Search strategies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The literature search aimed to identify all relevant
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CZP and SEC, and the comparators ETN,
ADA, INF, GOL, APR and UST for the treatment of PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The searches for CZP and SEC for PsA were not restricted by
date. However, as ETN, ADA, INF, GOL, APR and UST for PsA had been subject to
previous TAs, updated searches were performed based on the search dates of
these previous TAs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The search strategy was developed in MEDLINE (via Ovid) and
then adapted for use in the other resources searched. The strategy included
terms for PsA combined, using the Boolean operator AND, with terms for the
eight treatments. No language or geographical limits were applied. A study
design search filter to limit retrieval to RCTs was used where available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Search strategies were developed by an information
specialist with input from the project team. The MEDLINE search strategy was
checked by a second information specialist. The searches were carried out
during December 2015 and then updated on 28 April 2016 to capture more recent
studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, MEDLINE
In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR),
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), EMBASE, Health Technology
Assessment (HTA) database, PubMed, and the Science Citation Index (SCI).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, the following resources were searched for
ongoing, unpublished or grey literature: ClinicalTrials.gov, Conference
Proceedings Citation Index – Science (CPCI-S), EU Clinical Trials Register,
PROSPERO and the World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform portal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As DARE ceased at the end of March 2015, additional searches
for systematic reviews were carried out in MEDLINE and EMBASE to ensure that
any relevant systematic reviews were identified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Full search strategies can be found in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/app1/">Appendix 1</a><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Inclusion criteria</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two reviewers independently screened all titles and
abstracts. Full manuscripts of any titles/abstracts that were relevant were
obtained, where possible, and the relevance of each study was assessed by two
reviewers according to the inclusion criteria, described below. Any
discrepancies were resolved by involving a third reviewer. Studies available
only as abstracts were also included.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Study design</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Randomised or quasi-RCTs were eligible for the review of
clinical efficacy and safety. For the eligible interventions (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/#s3-1-2-2">Interventions</a><span
style='font-style:normal'>), all open-label extension studies of RCTs were
included. For the comparators (see&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/#s3-1-2-3">Comparators</a><span
style='font-style:normal'>), open-label extensions were identified and listed
with the main focus being on those studies that reported data relating to the
longest duration of follow-up available for each individual comparator.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To evaluate the adverse effect profiles of the different
biologics, the eligible study designs were systematic reviews that covered a
range of diseases and large observational studies in patients with PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prospective registry studies that included PsA patients
receiving biologics were eligible to provide data on treatment adherence,
treatment withdrawal, and the rates and efficacy of switching to new biologics
(i.e. sequential use). Potentially relevant registry studies were sought and
identified, with a focus on those deemed to be most clinically relevant and
appropriate to the UK setting. This decision was based on an examination of
study characteristics and discussion with our clinical adviser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studies were also sought on the longer-term natural history
of PsA in populations that have not taken a biologic therapy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Interventions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Certolizumab pegol and SEC were eligible at their licensed
doses (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table2/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 2</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). Studies comparing
these two treatments with each other were also eligible.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Comparators</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The relevant comparators were:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>placebo</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>DMARDs: MTX, sulfasalazine, leflunomide,
     hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine and ciclosporin</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>biologic therapies: ADA, ETN, GOL, INF and UST, including
     any licensed biosimilars</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>APR</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>best supportive care (BSC).</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Biologics and APR may have been used with or without
concomitant DMARDs. Only studies that included treatments used at their
licensed dose were eligible. Head-to-head trials of the five biologic
comparators (and biosimilars) and APR were eligible, but were anticipated to be
rare. Therefore, to allow comparisons of active treatments via network
meta-analysis (NMA), the biologic comparators and APR could also have been
compared with either placebo or a DMARD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Participants</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the evaluation of the effectiveness of CZP and SEC, the
included studies were of adults with active PsA for whom DMARDs had been
inadequately effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Outcomes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For CZP and SEC, studies reporting any of the following
outcomes were eligible:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>disease activity, using the following multidomain
     measures: PsARC, ACR 20, 50% improvement in the American College of
     Rheumatology criteria (ACR 50) and 70% improvement in the American College
     of Rheumatology criteria (ACR 70)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>functional capacity (assessed using HAQ-DI)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>radiographic assessment of disease progression</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>response of psoriatic skin lesions (assessed using PASI)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>measures of dactylitis, enthesitis and tendonitis</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>mortality</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>HRQoL, assessed using EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) or
     Short Form questionnaire-36 items (SF-36)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>adverse effects of treatment, focusing on the key adverse
     events (AEs) identified from previous studies of biologics: malignancies,
     serious infections, reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB), injection
     site reactions and withdrawals due to AEs.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Randomised controlled trials of comparators needed to report
at least one of the following: PsARC, ACR 20/50/70, PASI 50 (50% reduction in
PASI), PASI 75 (75% reduction in PASI), PASI 90 (90% reduction in PASI) or
HAQ-DI score.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For patient registry studies, treatment adherence, treatment
withdrawal, and the rates and efficacy of switching to new biologics (i.e.
sequential use) were the key outcomes of interest, and particularly those which
were identified as being useful to inform parameters in the economic model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Data extraction</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For SEC and CZP, data were extracted from published papers
and abstracts supplemented by data from the manufacturer submissions (when they
were not available from other sources). Data were extracted from previous
single technology appraisal (STA) or multiple technology appraisal (MTA)
reports for studies of ETN, INF, ADA, GOL, UST and APR. When missing or further
information on the trials of these treatments was needed, data were extracted
either from the relevant published trial reports or from reviews.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>36</sup></a><sup>–</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>39</sup></a>&nbsp;Some
data may have been missing in the original TAs because of commercial- or
academic-in-confidence restrictions; and some of these data may have
subsequently been published. Data for UST at the 12-week time point were
extracted from the full clinical study reports of PSUMMIT (Study of the Safety
and Effectiveness of Ustekinumab in Patients With Psoriatic Arthritis) 1 and 2
trials, which were accessed via the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA)
project. For APR, although only the Psoriatic Arthritis Long-term Assessment of
Clinical Efficacy (PALACE) 1 trial has been published, data from the PALACE 2
and 3 trials were extracted from STA documents on NICE’s website. All data for
these treatments were extracted by one reviewer and then checked for any transcription
errors by a second reviewer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the dichotomous responder outcomes (PsARC, ACR 20/50/70
and PASI 50/75/90), intention-to-treat (ITT) baseline denominators (i.e. the
number of patients randomised for each trial arm) were used, with patients
assumed to be non-responders where data were missing. This explains why there
is a small difference in the ADalimumab Effectiveness in Psoriatic arthritis
Trial (ADEPT) denominators used between this current MTA, the previous MTA and
the manufacturers’ submissions (the last two used the ‘modified ITT’ data
whereby patients had to have received at least one dose of study treatment).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Data on study design, participant characteristics, efficacy
outcomes and quality were extracted by one reviewer using a standardised data
extraction form and independently checked by a second reviewer for the SEC and
CZP trials. Disagreements were resolved through consensus. For the comparator
treatments, most of the data were copied (from previous reports) by one
reviewer and then checked for any transcription errors by a second reviewer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Attempts were made, where possible, to contact authors for
missing data. Data from studies with multiple publications were extracted and
reported as a single study. For the open-label extension studies of comparator
treatments, only the data relating to the latest time point were extracted.
Data were also extracted from the manufacturers’ submissions when they were not
available from other sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quality assessment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The quality of the RCTs was assessed using a modified
version of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, which incorporated an assessment of
baseline imbalance.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>40</sup></a>&nbsp;The
assessments of baseline imbalance were made based on evidence from a systematic
review of predictors of treatment response to anti-TNFs.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>41</sup></a>&nbsp;The
review identified several possible such predictors in patients with PsA,
although none was identified as being conclusive owing to the limited number of
studies and the heterogeneity of response measures. We looked at baseline CRP
concentration, age and sex. The characteristics of young age, male sex and high
CRP concentration may be predictive of a better response. Risk-of-bias
assessments were performed by one reviewer and checked independently by a
second reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved through consensus or by
involvement of a third reviewer if necessary. Open-label extension studies were
less formally evaluated. This was based on assessing imputation methods, the
patient withdrawal criteria used and the clinical relevance of any treatment
stopping/changing rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Methods of data synthesis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The study characteristics and quality assessment results
were tabulated and summarised narratively. Where possible, the clinical
effectiveness data for the PsARC, ACR, PASI and HAQ-DI outcomes were

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quantity and quality of the identified evidence</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A total of 1761 records were retrieved from the original
December 2015 electronic database searches. The searches were updated on 28
April 2016, with a further 200 records available for screening. After screening
titles and abstracts, full copies of 182 papers were assessed for inclusion in
the review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two RCTs were excluded at the abstract stage for using
unlicensed dosages (50&#8201;mg of ETN twice weekly,<a

20 and 40&#8201;mg of APR<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>43</sup></a>).
Two RCTs were excluded at the full-paper stage: one did not report subgroup
results for PsA<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>44</sup></a>&nbsp;and
the other included only patients who were naive to MTX.<a

<p class=MsoNormal>Treatment doses studied in the review of short-term efficacy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The design of many trials typically included a fully
blinded, placebo-controlled phase followed by an ‘early escape’ crossover phase
(from placebo to an active treatment) for non-responders, then finally
crossover to active treatment for the remaining placebo participants.
Non-response in this context related to failure to achieve prespecified minimum
improvements (ranging between 5% and 20%) in tender joint count (TJC) and
swollen joint count (SJC). All the trials using an early escape design ran for
16 weeks before patients were eligible for early escape. Trials then entered
open-label extension phases (see&nbsp;<i><a

patients were available only for the more recent trials (those of SEC, CZP, UST
and APR); in the earlier trials such patients were not eligible to participate.
Trial sample sizes varied, with earlier trials tending to be smaller than more
recent trials. Variation in sample size was also evident within treatments: the
two trials of ETN had populations of 60 and 205,<a

<p class=MsoNormal>Baseline population characteristics of the included
randomised trials</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notwithstanding this limited heterogeneity, many key patient
characteristics were broadly similar across trials, including mean ages (which
ranged from 45 to 51 years), the proportion of male participants (around 50%
for most trials), and TJCs and SJCs (TJC, range 18–29; SJC, range 9–18); an
exception was the three-arm head-to-head trial, which had notably lower TJC and
SJC.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>64</sup></a>&nbsp;The
population in this trial, along with the PsA populations from the large SEC
psoriasis trials,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;also
had markedly higher baseline PASI scores than the other trials (typically
around two to three times higher). The FUTURE 2 SEC trial had slightly higher
baseline PASI scores than the other trials, most notably in the 150&#8201;mg
treatment arm. The PsA populations from two of the SEC psoriasis trials<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;also
had lower baseline HAQ-DI scores (range 0.5–0.8&#8201;units) than the other
trials (range 0.9–1.6&#8201;units). In light of these differences, the
characteristics of the PsA patients in the SEC psoriasis trials were deemed to
be too dissimilar to the other trials to be included in the NMAs. There were
three of these psoriasis trials: Efficacy of Response and Safety of Two Fixed
Secukinumab Regimens in Psoriasis (ERASURE), Full Year Investigative
Examination of Secukinumab vs. Etanercept Using Two Dosing Regimens to
Determine Efficacy in Psoriasis (FIXTURE) and Efficacy of Secukinumab Compared
to Ustekinumab in Patients with Plaque-type Psoriasis (CLEAR; baseline data
were not available for the PsA patients in CLEAR). To be eligible for the
ERASURE, FIXTURE and CLEAR trials, patients had to have moderate–severe
psoriasis based on a PASI score of &gt;&#8201;12 units and BSA involvement of
&#8805;&#8201;10%.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>49</sup></a>&nbsp;In
the trials only of patients with PsA, the proportion of patients with at least
moderate psoriasis (i.e. PASI-evaluable patients, defined as a BSA involvement
of &#8805;&#8201;3%) ranged between 41% and 87%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the FUTURE 2 (SEC)<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;and
RAPID-PsA (CZP)<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;trials,
the biologic-experienced and biologic-naive subgroups were broadly similar
except that the biologic-experienced subgroups tended to have slightly higher
TJCs and SJCs, and slightly longer durations of PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the trials of ETN, INF, ADA and GOL and one UST trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>58</sup></a>&nbsp;(nine
in total) excluded patients who had previously received an anti-TNF, so their
populations comprised entirely biologic-naive patients (<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table5/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 5</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). In the remaining
trials, where reported, the proportion of biologic-experienced patients ranged
from 15% to 58%. Of the trials that allowed recruitment of biologic-experienced
patients, the RAPID-PsA trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;was
more selective than the FUTURE 2,<a

the only trial that excluded patients with primary failure of a previous
anti-TNF (primary failure was defined as no response within the first 12 weeks
of treatment with the anti-TNF). (See&nbsp;</span><a

maintenance dose. Although this trial was therefore not eligible to contribute
data to the review of efficacy of SEC, nor to be included in the evidence
synthesis, it has been used to provide supportive evidence on SEC as, unlike

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Efficacy at 12–24 weeks in the full-trial population</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the whole-trial population, SEC was associated with
statistically significant improvements in all outcomes at all time points.
Patients taking SEC were around six times more likely to be ACR 50 responders –
an outcome of particular clinical importance to patients – than patients taking
placebo. An increase in RRs is apparent when looking across the PsARC, ACR 20,
ACR 50 and ACR 70 columns in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table12/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 12</a><span style='font-style:normal'>. These increases in
RR are likely to be a consequence of the different placebo rates, with higher
rates for the lower threshold outcomes (see the placebo rates in&nbsp;</span><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table8/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 8</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). The lower threshold
outcomes (such as PsARC and ACR 20) appear to underestimate efficacy because
the RRs tend to be diluted by the high placebo response rates. This association
of higher placebo responses with lower relative efficacy was also noted&nbsp;</span>across</i>&nbsp;trials
by outcome in the evidence synthesis and is discussed in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/ukhta2156/s4/">Chapter 4</a><span

href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;trial
patients taking 150 or 300&#8201;mg of SEC were also around six to seven times
more likely to be PASI 50 responders than patients taking placebo. Efficacy was
also demonstrated for the higher PASI thresholds (PASI 75 and PASI 90), with
the 300-mg group having only slightly higher RRs than the 150-mg group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All three study arms showed improvements in physical
function as assessed using HAQ-DI change from baseline scores; HAQ-DI assesses
a patient’s ability to perform eight categories of activities of daily living.
Patients taking SEC had greater reductions in HAQ-DI scores than patients
taking the placebo (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table8/?report=objectonly"

difference when compared with placebo (–0.25&#8201;units) was statistically

subgroup results are difficult to interpret for several reasons. Some of the
subgroup sample sizes were particularly small: there were no placebo responders

confidence intervals (CIs) were therefore extremely wide. The PASI results are
effectively based on subgroups (previous biologic status) of a subgroup
(patients with psoriasis covering &#8805;&#8201;3% of BSA). Placebo response
rates also differed across subgroups (see&nbsp;</span><a

href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;demonstrated
the short-term efficacy of SEC in treating PsA. When considering the
whole-trial population, SEC was associated with statistically and clinically
significant improvements in all key outcomes. Patients taking SEC were around
six times more likely to be ACR 50 responders – a key clinical outcome to
patients – than patients taking placebo. Clinically important improvements in
activities of daily living (assessed using the HAQ-DI) were also evident in
patients taking SEC, particularly in patients who were PsARC responders.
However, when the trial population was split into subgroups based on previous
biologic experience, the resulting RRs for the biologic-experienced subgroup
became difficult to interpret. This was attributable to both the low numbers of
placebo patients and the differences in placebo response rates across subgroups
(see&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/#s3-4">Evaluating
the secukinumab and certolizumab pegol trial results in comparison with other
treatments</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). Although SEC is efficacious in
both subgroups, it is not possible to make robust conclusions about any
difference in the efficacy of SEC across these subgroups. Similar efficacy
across the ACR outcomes was evident in subgroups of patients based on presence
or absence of concomitant MTX, although limited data and analyses were
available specifically for the one prior DMARD group. Treatment with SEC
resulted in statistically significant improvements in HRQoL measures and in the
resolution of both dactylitis and enthesitis.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Results from the trials of patients with more severe
psoriasis demonstrated SEC’s superiority over placebo in terms of psoriasis (as
measured by the PASI) and function (as measured by the HAQ-DI) outcomes. SEC
was also found to be significantly more effective than ETN in improving
psoriasis (assessed using PASI 75 and PASI 90). However, the populations
studied in these trials had quite severe psoriasis and less functional
impairment (lower baseline HAQ-DI scores) than other trial populations. Their
results should not therefore be generalised to more typical PsA populations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One eligible RCT of CZP was identified. RAPID-PsA<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;compared
200 or 400&#8201;mg of CZP against placebo up to 24 weeks. The trial was dose
blinded to 48 weeks and then open label to 216 weeks. Placebo patients who
failed to achieve a 10% improvement from baseline in both swollen and tender
joints at week 14 and 16 were re-randomised to active treatment at week 16. At
week 24, all the remaining placebo patients were re-randomised to receive 200
or 400&#8201;mg of CZP. The RAPID-PsA<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;trial
was judged as being at low overall risk of bias (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table6/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 6</a><span style='font-style:normal'>).</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Compared with the other PsA trials, the RAPID-PsA trial was
more selective in recruiting biologic-experienced patients; patients with
primary failure of a previous anti-TNF were excluded (primary failure was
defined as no response within the first 12 weeks of treatment with the
anti-TNF).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are no UCB Pharma-sponsored ongoing studies of CZP in
patients with PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Efficacy at 12–24 weeks in the RAPID PsA full-trial
population</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the full-trial population, the RRs in&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table25/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 25</a><span style='font-style:normal'>&nbsp;are for
comparisons of the different CZP regimens (200&#8201;mg every 2 weeks or
400&#8201;mg every 4 weeks) with placebo, across the 12-, 16- and 24-week time
points and across the PsARC, ACR and PASI outcomes. For the subgroup analyses
(based on previous biologic status), combined data from the two CZP arms were
used to calculate RRs.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the full-trial population, when compared with placebo,
CZP was associated with statistically significant improvements in all outcomes
at all time points (for which data were available). Patients taking CZP were
around three times more likely to be ACR 50 responders than patients taking
placebo. Similar to the pattern seen with the SEC FUTURE 2 trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;results,
an increase in RRs is apparent as the outcome thresholds (for achieving a
response) increase across the PsARC, ACR and PASI outcomes (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table25/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 25</a><span style='font-style:normal'>). Again, these
increases are likely to be a consequence of the different placebo rates, with
higher rates of placebo response in the lower threshold outcomes.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The RAPID-PsA trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;patients
taking CZP were around two-and-a-half times more likely to be PASI 50
responders than patients taking placebo. Efficacy was also demonstrated in the
results for the higher PASI thresholds. Improvements in physical function, as
assessed using HAQ-DI change from baseline scores, were also seen, with the
difference being reported as being statistically significant (<i>p</i>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.001)

likely to have been influenced by two factors. First, there is a problem with
sample size, with low numbers of placebo patients and PRs in the
biologic-experienced subgroup. There is therefore considerable uncertainty
about these estimates, which is reflected in the very wide CIs. Second, there
is a notable difference in placebo response rates between the two subgroups

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The results of the RAPID-PsA trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;demonstrated
the short-term efficacy of CZP in treating PsA. When considering the full-trial
population, CZP was associated with statistically significant improvements in
all key outcomes. When the trial population was split into subgroups based on
previous biologic experience, the results became difficult to compare (as was
seen in the FUTURE 2 trial). The small number of placebo patients in the
biologic-experienced subgroup coupled with higher placebo response rates in the
biologic-naive subgroup meant that it was not possible to make reliable
conclusions about the difference in the efficacy of CZP across these subgroups.
Furthermore, patients with primary failure of a previous biologic were excluded
from the RAPID-PsA trial, so estimates of efficacy may have been slightly
inflated when comparisons were made with other trials that recruited
biologic-experienced patients (e.g. FUTURE 2<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;and
PSUMMIT 2<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>59</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>66</sup></a>).
Similar efficacy across the ACR and PsARC outcomes was seen in subgroups of
patients based on presence or absence of a concomitant DMARD and (confidential
information has been removed). Treatment with CZP resulted in statistically
significant improvements in HRQoL measures and in the resolution of both
dactylitis and enthesitis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Evaluating the secukinumab and certolizumab pegol trial
results in comparison with other treatments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to more fully evaluate the clinical efficacy of SEC
and CZP, the trial results of these two newer biologics need to be compared
with each other and with the results of the older biologics (and APR). However,
this is not straightforward for two reasons. First, there is variation across
trials with respect to previous biologic use.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The populations recruited to clinical trials have changed
     over time, with earlier trials excluding biologic-experienced patients and
     later trials including such patients.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The RAPID-PsA trial was more selective than the FUTURE 2,<a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;PSUMMIT
     2<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>59</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>66</sup></a>&nbsp;and
     PALACE trials<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>60</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a

     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>65</sup></a>&nbsp;in
     recruiting its biologic-experienced patients: only in RAPID-PsA were
     patients with primary failure of a previous biologic excluded (see&nbsp;<i><a
     href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/#s3-3">Characteristics

     short-term efficacy</a><span style='font-style:normal'>).</span></i></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, placebo response rates have increased markedly over
time across the trials included in this review. This issue is key when
interpreting RRs because, although RRs are easy to interpret clinically, their
ceilings (maximum values) are limited by baseline response rates. For example,
in the FUTURE 2 trial<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;the

<p class=MsoNormal>Unadjusted RRs (compared with placebo) across the trials
included in the evidence synthesis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Examination of the trial baseline characteristics across
trials offers no clear reason as to why placebo response rates in biologic
trials have increased over time. The PsARC placebo response rates increased
most markedly from 2013 onwards, starting with the PSUMMIT trials.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>60</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>61</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>65</sup></a>&nbsp;One
theory is that patient and clinician expectations have increased over time
(i.e. more caution and lower expectations when the first biologics were
trialled, and more confidence about the likely benefits in more recent trials).
Subjective patient- and clinician-reported outcomes such as PsARC and ACR may
be prone to such expectation effects. This theory might also explain why,
within trials, higher placebo response rates are observed in the biologic-naive
subgroups than in biologic-experienced subgroups, where treatment expectations
might be lower. Coupled with this is the trend – beginning with the PSUMMIT
trials – for increases in the number of active treatment arms offered in
trials: typically there was one active arm in the early trials and two or more
active arms in more recent trials (e.g. the FUTURE 2 SEC trial had three active
treatment arms: 75, 150 and 300&#8201;mg). Patients in the more recent trials
might therefore also be more confident and optimistic about the likelihood that
they are receiving an active treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ideally the different treatments would be compared in
head-to-head trials. However, only one trial identified in the systematic
review compared two or more biologics directly in a PsA population. The
Atteno&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>64</sup></a>&nbsp;compared
INF, ETN and ADA. It reported that patients on INF and ADA showed the greatest
improvement in terms of PASI (statistically significantly better than ETN),
whereas patients on ETN showed the greatest improvement in TJC (statistically
significantly better than INF and ADA) and HAQ-DI (statistically significantly
better than ADA). However, the reliability of this study’s results are limited
somewhat by its small size (100 patients were randomised in total). This trial
also did not report its methods clearly (see&nbsp;<i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/table/table6/?report=objectonly"
target=object>Table 6</a><span style='font-style:normal'>), and was rated as
being at high risk of bias (although blinding would be difficult to achieve in
such a trial). Finally, by reporting results only at the 52-week time point,
the results of this trial could not be included in our NMAs.</span></i></p>

not eligible for the systematic review of efficacy because it initiated the

(10&#8201;mg/kg), it did use a 150-mg maintenance dose and so can be considered
to provide useful long-term data. Importantly, this trial reported radiographic

of the dichotomous data reported in the submission used non-responder

achievement of much later responses than would be viable in the NHS. For time

deemed not to be benefiting from the study treatment based on lack of

<p class=MsoNormal>In the NHS, patients will typically be allowed 16 weeks to
achieve a response, after which SEC may be stopped in non-responding patients.
The Assessment Group (AG) requested results specifically for patients who are
responders at 16 weeks to inform what happens to this group of patients in the
longer term. The results (<i><a

lower threshold outcomes – such as ACR 20 and PASI 50 – response rates remain
high from week 16 to week 52. As the outcome thresholds increase, response
rates become more variable over time and there is generally a greater decrease
in response rates than the lower threshold outcomes. Around 70% of patients on

<p class=MsoNormal>The Golimumab – A Randomized Evaluation of Safety and
Efficacy in Subjects with Psoriatic Arthritis Using a Human Anti-TNF Monoclonal
Antibody (GO-REVEAL) study<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>75</sup></a>&nbsp;reported
results at 5 years using the originally randomised ITT groups. Across the
groups the proportion of responders ranged from 63% to 70% for ACR 20, from 43%
to 51% for ACR 50 and from 61% to 72% for PASI 75. Mean changes from baseline
in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde score ranged from 0.1 to 0.3&#8201;units.
Clinically important improvements in HAQ-DI scores (a decrease of
&#8805;&#8201;0.3&#8201;units) were seen for 52–58% of randomised patients. The
use of concomitant MTX at baseline did not affect ACR 20 or PASI 75, but did
appear to reduce radiographic progression when a comparison was made with
patients who did not use concomitant MTX at baseline. Although some method
details were not fully clear, it appeared that the data imputations used were
not conservative enough. For example, it seems that LOCF was used for patients
who stopped treatment as a result of an AE (so a patient responding well to
treatment but who discontinued treatment early in the study as a result of an
AE was counted as a responder at 5 years). In addition, it was unclear whether
or not there were any stopping rules – such as how long non-responders were
allowed to remain on treatment – which raises further uncertainties about the
study’s applicability to clinical practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The follow-up for the Mease&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;ETN
trial<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>54</sup></a>&nbsp;extended
to 2 years and consisted of three phases: the 24-week initial randomised phase,
an optional 24-week maintenance therapy phase (according to randomised
assignment) and a 48-week open-label phase. Most results were given as
percentages and it was not fully clear what the denominator was for some
results. Several results were presented only as graphs. Very few data were
provided on reasons for withdrawal from the study and HAQ-DI results were not
reported. The ACR response results were similar to those seen in the GO-REVEAL
trial (at 5 years), although the proportions of PASI 75 responders were
markedly lower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ADEPT ADA trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>78</sup></a>&nbsp;was
extended to 2.75 years for radiographic progression outcomes and to 2 years for
other outcomes. The ACR 50 results were similar to those seen for the ETN and
GOL open-label studies. PASI 75 results were only presented in a graph; the
response was around 60% (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;128), which is similar to the
GO-REVEAL trial’s PASI 75 result at 5 years. Non-responders could increase
their dose from 40&#8201;mg every other week (the recommended dose) to
40&#8201;mg weekly; this occurred in 54 (19%) patients. The use of LOCF
imputation for missing data for the ACR, PASI and PsARC outcomes is different
(potentially much less conservative) from the imputations used in the
placebo-controlled phase, where non-responder imputations were used. This is
likely to have inflated the response rates in the open-label phase. The results
for HAQ-DI remained very stable throughout the 2 years. These open-label HAQ-DI
results are similar to the placebo-controlled, fully blinded 24-week phase in
which HAQ-DI scores remained the same between week 12 and week 24 in both the
ADA and the placebo groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The UST PSUMMIT 1 trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>80</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>81</sup></a>&nbsp;was
extended to 108 weeks, with efficacy data evaluated at 100 weeks. The change
from baseline Sharp/van der Heijde radiographic progression scores varied
across the three treatment groups. The change from baseline HAQ-DI results
ranged between –0.36 and –0.45&#8201;units, similar to the ADA study results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For INF, IMPACT<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>79</sup></a>&nbsp;was
extended to 98 weeks. The data for all patients were summarised as one group
(as for the ADA open-label study). At 98 weeks, 46% and 34% were ACR 20 and ACR
50 responders, respectively. The mean change in the modified Sharp/van der
Heijde score was 1.2&#8201;units, which is similar to the results in the UST
PSUMMIT 1.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>80</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>81</sup></a>&nbsp;However,
the result was based on 41% of the initial 104 patients. The authors also
acknowledged that the 2-year radiographic progression result may have reflected
non-linear progression of damage, with more damage occurring in earlier disease
stages. Mean changes from baseline were not available for the HAQ-DI.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For APR, the PALACE 1 trial<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>61</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>82</sup></a>&nbsp;was
extended to 2 years. There were no separate results for the patients at 104
weeks who were in the placebo group at the beginning of the trial. In the 30-mg
group, at 2 years 40% of patients were ACR 20 responders and 30% were PASI 75
responders. The HAQ-DI result may be an overestimate, as it was based on data
from patients remaining in the study at 2 years (i.e. observed data). No data
were reported on any radiographic progression outcomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Summary</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The uncontrolled nature of open-label extension studies
means that it is often very difficult to determine the magnitude of effects
that can be ascribed only to active treatment; results should generally be
viewed with much more caution than the results of the earlier randomised
controlled study phases. Furthermore, it is not straightforward to compare
long-term results across different treatments because of the variation in
outcomes and time points reported. There is also variation in the methodological
approaches used for analyses and for imputing missing data. Additionally, most
studies did not report whether or not there were any treatment stopping rules,
and it is likely that the decisions made regarding continuation of treatment
were not reflective of those used in the NHS, limiting the applicability of
many of these results. For example, in the open-label ADEPT<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>78</sup></a>&nbsp;non-responders
after 12 weeks had their dose doubled – the opposite of what would be expected
in practice (when treatment with ADA would have been stopped).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With these caveats in mind, the results relating
specifically to those patients who were responders at 12 or 16 weeks appear to
be the most clinically relevant and useful (for the dichotomous outcomes),
although such data were available only for CZP and SEC (confidential
information has been removed).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The available data on disease progression based on
radiographic assessments of joint damage indicate that, after 2 years of
treatment, CZP effectively reduces disease progression, with results being
similar to those observed in the open-label studies of the other anti-TNFs. For
SEC, fewer result details were available at 2 years, although the results also
indicated effective reduction in radiographic disease progression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For long-term HAQ-DI results, missing data were often
imputed using LOCF, which is not the most conservative of approaches for this
outcome. Notwithstanding this, the results suggest that HAQ-DI gains remain
stable in PsA patients treated with biologics. The 2-year open-label HAQ-DI
results from ADEPT were similar to the placebo-controlled, fully blinded
24-week phase in which HAQ-DI scores remained the same between week 12 and week
24 in both the ADA and the placebo groups. This stability of HAQ-DI scores over
time was also seen in the open-label studies of CZP (data up to 4 years) and
SEC (data to 1 year).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Withdrawal rates as a result of AEs or loss of efficacy were
low in both the FUTURE 2<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>48</sup></a>&nbsp;(5%
at 52 weeks) and RAPID-PsA<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>47</sup></a>&nbsp;trials
(around 10% at 52 weeks).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The database of references, which resulted from the searches
for RCTs, was also screened to identify registries containing PsA patients and
the corresponding publication output. The results of this search were
supplemented by separate searches for the output of the identified patient
registries reporting information on their PsA cohorts. A library of 165
potentially relevant studies was assembled and screened fully, from which there
were 12 studies<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>83</sup></a><sup>–</sup><a

and switching</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These studies were all retrospective analyses of prospective
patient registers from primarily European countries (10 studies<a

with one Australian study<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>89</sup></a>&nbsp;and
another from the USA.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>87</sup></a>&nbsp;The
majority of patients in each of the registries had been treated with ETN, ADA
or INF; two of the studies named other anti-TNF-&#945; treatments, GOL and CZP,
but neither had sufficient data to provide individual drug survival information
for these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Drug survival was reported in a number of ways: as the
number of patients remaining on treatment at a given time point; as the
proportion of patients remaining on treatment at each time point; or as the
median duration patients remained on treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Treatment withdrawal rates in patients who had switched
anti-TNFs were reported in three studies.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>83</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>94</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>95</sup></a>&nbsp;The
Danish Database for Biological Therapies (DANBIO) registry<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>94</sup></a>&nbsp;reported
up to three sequential anti-TNFs, with 548 patients who had switched treatment
once, and 189 patients who had switched treatment twice. The UK’s British
Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register (BSRBR)<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>83</sup></a>&nbsp;also
reported drug survival rates for its population of 178 one-time switchers over
2 years, whereas the 95 switchers in the Norwegian Antirheumatic Drug Register
(NOR-DMARD)<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>95</sup></a>&nbsp;were
followed for 3 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the first course of anti-TNF treatment, the proportion
of patients remaining on treatment ranged from 60% to 88% at 1 year, from 57%
to 81% at 2 years and from 55% to 73% at 3 years. Three studies reported first
anti-TNF drug survival rates for &#8805;&#8201;5 years: (1) the BSRBR study,<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>84</sup></a>&nbsp;in
which 47% of patients were still on the initial anti-TNF treatment at 5 years;
(2) the Southern Sweden Antirheumatic Therapy Group study,<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>85</sup></a>&nbsp;which
reported 5-year survival of around 40%; and (3) the study conducted by another
Swedish registry, Antirheumatic Therapies In Sweden,<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>86</sup></a>&nbsp;which
reported 6-year first anti-TNF drug survival of 37% and 8-year survival of 32%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The median first anti-TNF survival time across all anti-TNFs
was reported as 2.5–2.9 years.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>87</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>88</sup></a>&nbsp;One
study reported this separately by anti-TNF: ETN, 2.62 years; ADA, 4.21 years;
and INF, 1.92 years.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Drug survival was consistently lower in patients who
switched anti-TNF than in those who did not. The DANBIO<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>94</sup></a>&nbsp;register
had the largest population of switchers; the median drug survival for a first
anti-TNF was 2.2 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.5) years, whereas median drug survival for a
second anti-TNF was 1.3 years (95% CI 1.0 to 1.6 years) (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;548),
and was 1.1 years (95% CI 0.7 to 1.5 years) (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;189) for
those on a third anti-TNF.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is some evidence suggesting that drug survival varies
between types of anti-TNF; both the Australian Rheumatology Association
Database register and the BSRBR study report rates for individual therapies,
and both indicate that ADA and ETN are associated with considerably higher
survival rates than INF. Two studies reported the impact of concomitant MTX or
other DMARDs.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>85</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>87</sup></a>&nbsp;One
reported a small increase in drug survival at 1 year (from 65% to 80%), but
this effect was diminished at 3 years (from 55% to 60%) and 5 years (from 37.5%
to 40%).<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>85</sup></a>&nbsp;The
other study reported that median drug survival time for anti-TNF-&#945;
monotherapy was 30.8 months, compared with 32.4 months for combination therapy
(anti-TNF&#8201;+&#8201;MTX or DMARD).<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>87</sup></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reasons for discontinuation of treatment varied widely
between studies, due in part to the inconsistency of observation period
duration. Across all registries, between 20% and 35% of patients withdrew from
treatment because of a lack of efficacy and, generally, a smaller proportion
withdrew as a result of AEs. The frequency of occurrence of AEs was linked to
the types of anti-TNF used and whether or not patients received concomitant
MTX, which was generally found to reduce AE frequency when MTX subgroups were
analysed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only one study reported an analysis of response rates; this
was based on the 3-month response rates from the NOR-DMARD (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;439).<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>90</sup></a>&nbsp;A
retrospective comparison of response rates in switchers and non-switchers found
that switchers had a lower response rate to the first anti-TNF: for ACR 50,
30.5% compared with 40%. In addition, the response to the second anti-TNF was
lower than to the first: 22.5% (compared with 30.5%, although this difference
was not statistically significant). The same pattern was seen for ACR 20 and 70
and, for the latter, the difference reached statistical significance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, across all relevant studies, those patients who
switched treatment had a shorter median drug survival time, also showing a
continuously smaller proportion of patients remaining on each subsequent
treatment option. This may reflect a lack of improvement in treatment response
after switching biologic; however, there are limited direct data on the effect
of sequential treatments on relevant outcome measures. The proportion of
patients withdrawing from treatment because of a lack of effect also seems to
increase with the number of times a patient switches anti-TNF therapy. The
registry data suggest that, although patients can benefit from a second (or
further) anti-TNF, the expected benefit from anti-TNFs diminishes after
switching, with a reduced chance of response and reduced drug survival.</p>

progression and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index score</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four patient registry studies that provided longitudinal
data on the effect of anti-TNFs on HAQ-DI scores were identified, one of which
also reported on radiographic progression. The results of these are presented

<p class=MsoNormal>Registries reporting the effects of anti-TNF treatment on
HAQ-DI and radiographic progression</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One study<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>96</sup></a>&nbsp;reported
on radiographic progression; a comparison of anti-TNF and MTX found an
inhibitory effect of anti-TNF on radiographic progression over 4 years of
observation. Radiographic progression was measured in terms of newly forming
erosions and change in a modified Steinbrocker score; radiographic progression
according to both measures was significantly more prevalent in the MTX group at
each follow-up assessment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four studies<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>88</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>90</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a

href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>97</sup></a>&nbsp;reported
on disease progression in terms of HAQ-DI score for between 6 months and 5
years at varying frequency. Eder&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>96</sup></a>&nbsp;compared
HAQ-DI score change in 70 patients treated with MTX and 65 patients on an
anti-TNF, finding no significant difference in HAQ-DI score between the groups
at the two assessments at up to 4 years from baseline. The HAQ-DI score was
measured in 658 patients receiving anti-TNFs for 5 years in the largest cohort<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>88</sup></a>&nbsp;(the
DANBIO register). The baseline mean HAQ-DI score was 1.0&#8201;unit, decreasing
to 0.3&#8201;units by 3 years, and increasing to 0.5&#8201;units at 5 years.
This suggests sustained long-term improvement of functional status during
anti-TNF treatment, although the number of patients at each time point after
the 6-month assessment decreased significantly. Therefore, the trend of
improving HAQ-DI scores observed in this study is potentially due to a higher
attrition of patients, with greater functional impairment skewing the data. The
third study on HAQ-DI change is from the NOR-DMARD,<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>90</sup></a>&nbsp;and
showed an improvement in HAQ-DI score from 0.7&#8201;units at baseline to
0.39&#8201;units at 3 months, and 0.38&#8201;units at 6 months. This study also
found no significant difference in HAQ-DI response in patients receiving MTX
compared with those on biologics alone. The BSRBR<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>97</sup></a>&nbsp;study
followed an initial cohort of 562 patients on biologics for 18 months. This
group of patients appears to have had more advanced disease (12 years since
onset) and poorer functional status than those in the other included studies,
with a median baseline HAQ-DI score of 1.88&#8201;units (95% CI 1.38 to
2.25&#8201;units). There is a 0.63-unit decrease in HAQ-DI score between
baseline and 6 months of treatment, representing what the authors describe as a
clinically important improvement. The median HAQ-DI score then increases to and
remains at 1.38&#8201;units (95% CI 0.63 to 2.00&#8201;units) at both the 12-
and 18-month assessments. Disease duration at the time of treatment initiation
in the BSRBR study was more than twice that in two of the aforementioned studies
on the HAQ-DI, showing that significant improvements in functional status are
achievable using anti-TNF therapy in advanced cases of PsA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Treatment with anti-TNFs appears to yield significant
improvement in radiographic progression and long-term HAQ-DI score change in
patient registry studies, although it is not clear to what extent the treatment
is responsible for the reduction in mean cohort HAQ-DI score over time.
Estimation of HAQ-DI score change using measures more robust to attrition bias
or profiling those lost to follow-up based on disease severity would have given
a truer representation of HAQ-DI score change in these cohorts. The paucity of
radiographic data in these registry studies is perhaps surprising given the
significance of radiographic damage as a measure of disease progression and
treatment effects. This lack of published data may be because few of these
registries were set up to record PsA-specific outcomes, and there has
historically been little consensus on a method for objectively taking and
scoring joint radiographs in this disease. It may be that HAQ-DI was usually
preferred as an acceptable and standardised proxy for assessing bone erosion
and, as a patient-reported outcome measure, can be cheaply and routinely
recorded without the need for specialist assessment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Registries reporting on natural history of PsA</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The studies explore changes in functional disability in
terms of HAQ-DI score and bone erosion as measures of disease activity and
progression over time. There is a great deal of variability between the three
cohorts under observation in terms of both baseline characteristics and
patterns of disease. It should be noted that disease classification of the NOAR
cohort<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>99</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>100</sup></a>&nbsp;was
performed retrospectively and both studies analysing the 79 patients emphasise
that they are unlikely to be representative of PsA patients, preferring instead
to refer to them as having polyarthritis plus psoriasis. The Morgan&nbsp;<i>et
al.</i><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>100</sup></a>&nbsp;study
analysed the change in median cohort HAQ-DI score over 5 years in 79 patients,
finding an increase of 0.125&#8201;units over the observation period,
indicating a small increase of 0.025&#8201;units in HAQ-DI score every year.
The patients in this analysis may or may not have been treated with DMARDs over
this period. The analysis in Rodgers&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp;includes
only those patients who had previously received two or more DMARDs at each time
point, finding an annual HAQ-DI score change of –0.060&#8201;units per year
over the first 2 years (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;24), and an annual increase of
0.077&#8201;units over years 3 to 5 (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;52). This
represents a faster progression of disease than that found in the Morgan&nbsp;<i>et
al.</i><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>100</sup></a>&nbsp;study,
but is inconsistent and derived from a small cohort of varying size.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A prospective cohort study of progression in early arthritis
carried out by Kane&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>99</sup></a>&nbsp;found
that HAQ-DI score changed from 0.71 units at baseline to 0.4 units at 1 year
and remained as such until the end of the 2-year observation period,
representing a decrease of 0.31 units. This decrease is likely to be explained
by the increase in uptake of DMARDs, as 12% of patients were receiving DMARD
treatment at baseline, compared with 59% at 1 year and 56% at 2 years. This was
the only study that recorded radiographic progression, finding consistent
increases across all measures between baseline and 2 years, despite the
simultaneous drop in HAQ-DI score. The Sharp erosion score increased from 1.2
units at baseline to 3 units at 2 years, demonstrating how HAQ-DI score change
may not reflect progressive radiographic damage, particularly during early
disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The study by Husted&nbsp;<i>et al.</i><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>98</sup></a>&nbsp;was
the longest and largest study of natural history of PsA, with 341 patients
included and observed for up to 10 years. This study found that the patient
population exhibited several patterns of disease progression, rather than just
universal consistent deterioration over time. Patients were assigned to one of
three disability states based on their HAQ-DI score. These were as follows: ‘no
disability’ (a HAQ-DI score of &lt;&#8201;0.5 units), ‘moderate disability’ (a
HAQ-DI score of 0.5–1.5 units) and ‘severe disability’ (a HAQ-DI score of
1.51–3.0 units). The transition of patients between groups was recorded over
the course of the observation period to ascertain the direction of change in
their symptoms. Forty-six per cent remained in the same disability group over
the course of the study, with 28% of these in the no disability state, 12% in
the moderate state and 6% in the severely disabled state. A total of 26.7% of
patients made a single transition between disability groups, reflecting steady
improvement or deterioration, and 27.3% experienced two or more transitions
between disability states. Although this methodology may reveal broad patterns
of disease progression, it appears to be insensitive to change within groups
and weights HAQ-DI score change near thresholds more highly (e.g. a patient
with a baseline HAQ-DI score at the lower end of a Markov group can experience
a significant worsening of their disability without progressing into the next
group). Mean HAQ-DI score change between consecutive assessments was
0.55&#8201;units (±&#8201;0.32&#8201;units) for those moving from a lower to a
higher state and –0.57 units (±&#8201;0.36 units) for those moving to a lower
state, with assessments being on average 1.29 years apart. In those patients
who did not move between groups, the mean HAQ-DI score change was –0.002 units
(±&#8201;0.215 units). A more complete picture of patterns of disease
progression would have been possible had there been more Markov states. The
mean HAQ-DI change for the majority of patients at any one time was effectively
zero, but this may conceal significant within-group changes in either
direction. Greater age was associated with a slower improvement in HAQ-DI score
in those in the moderate and severe disability groups, and disability worsened
more slowly in males than in females. Time since PsA diagnosis was related to
more frequent transition between disability states, and there was no
association between PASI score and transition between disability states. In
summary, this study indicates that functional disability (as measured via the
HAQ-DI) in PsA is generally stable over time in the majority of patients, but
there are groups who exhibit patterns of more rapidly worsening or improving
symptoms at certain periods, with some experiencing fluctuating deterioration
and improvement over time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Owing to the paucity of observational data on natural
history of PsA, it is difficult to produce accurate estimates of yearly disease
progression rates without anti-TNF therapy. None of the included studies can
claim to provide accurate long-term estimates on uncontrolled disease
progression. It is clear from the largest cohort that functional disability
deteriorates over time, but the course of HAQ-DI progression is not constant or
predictable. Therefore, it is unclear if an average rate of HAQ-DI change is a
useful statistic, as this change is neither constant nor generalisable to the
patient population. The Kane&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;study<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>99</sup></a>&nbsp;does
show that, despite reductions in functional disability in early-stage disease
under DMARD therapy, radiographic progression continues to occur, which
theoretically will ultimately result in worsening disability in the long term;
however, because of the lack of large and long-term observational studies,
HAQ-DI change over time in uncontrolled PsA is yet to be properly measured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Randomised trials of certolizumab pegol or secukinumab
for psoriatic arthritis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Secukinumab: FUTURE 2</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the 16-week placebo-controlled period, AEs were
reported in 54% and 58% of patients in the pooled SEC and placebo groups,
respectively. The most frequently reported AEs up to 16 weeks in any SEC group
(vs. placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection [(confidential information
has been removed) vs. 7%], nasopharyngitis [(confidential information has been
removed) vs. 8%], headache [(confidential information has been removed) vs.
4%], nausea [(confidential information has been removed) vs. 4%], diarrhoea
[(confidential information has been removed) vs. 3%] and urinary tract
infection [(confidential information has been removed) vs. 4%]. Rates of
infections and infestations were similar across treatment groups (27% on any
SEC dose vs. 31% placebo), and no cases of active TB were reported.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The majority of AEs that occurred up to week 16 were mild
[(confidential information has been removed) of AEs on any SEC dose and
(confidential information has been removed) on placebo] or moderate
[(confidential information has been removed) AEs on any SEC dose and
(confidential information has been removed) on placebo] in severity. Severe AEs
were reported in five patients (1.7% of pooled SEC population), compared with
none in patients on placebo. Around 3% of patients in the SEC groups reported
non-fatal serious adverse events (SAEs), compared with 2% on placebo. More
patients in the placebo group than in the pooled SEC group discontinued study
treatment as a result of an AE (confidential information has been removed).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Certolizumab pegol: RAPID-PsA</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the 24-week period, the incidence of drug-related AEs
was 26% in the pooled CZP group and 27% in the placebo group and they were
mostly of mild intensity (51% pooled CZP vs. 54% placebo) or moderate intensity
(30% pooled CZP vs. 36% placebo). The incidence of serious AEs was 6.6% in the
pooled CZP group and 4.4% in the placebo group. The incidence of SAEs was 5.8%
in the CZP 200&#8201;mg group and 9.6% in the CZP 400&#8201;mg group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Confidential information has been removed.) The most common
serious AEs were infections (confidential information has been removed).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Open-label extensions of randomised controlled trials of

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Secukinumab: FUTURE 2</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the 52-week time point, the most common AEs experienced
in patients receiving 300&#8201;mg were infection and infestations (79 cases
per 100 patient-years), upper respiratory tract infection (18 per 100
patient-years) and nasopharyngitis (14 per 100 patient-years). The rate of
discontinuation as a result of AEs in patients who received at least one dose
of 150&#8201;mg of SEC was 2%. No deaths were reported.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Secukinumab: FUTURE 1</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At week 104, 79% of patients remained in the open-label
extension study. Infections and infestations were the most common AEs reported,
occurring at a rate of 68 per 100 patient-years. Malignant or unspecified
tumours occurred at a rate of 0.3 per 100 patient-years, and major adverse
cardiac event rates occurred at a rate of 0.7 per 100 patient-years. No cases
of active TB or suicide were reported. At week 52 the rate of discontinuation
as a result of AEs was 3.9%.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Pooled safety analysis of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic
arthritis trials</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A conference abstract reported a pooled safety analysis for
seven Phase III SEC trials: five plaque psoriasis trials {ERASURE, FIXTURE,
SCULPTURE [Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Secukinumab (AIN457) for
Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque-type Psoriasis Assessing Different Doses and
Dose Regimens], FEATURE (First Study of Secukinumab in Pre-filled Syringes in

trials (FUTURE 1 and FUTURE 2).<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>101</sup></a>&nbsp;All
trials except FUTURE 2 contributed data up to (at least) 52 weeks; FUTURE had
data up to 24 weeks. A total of 3928 patients received at least one dose of SEC
(3225 patient-years of exposure; mean exposure 299.8 days for SEC and 105.7
days for placebo). Exposure-adjusted incidence rates per 100 patient-years for
SEC and placebo were, respectively, 241 and 329 for AEs, 8 and 10 days for
SAEs, and 93 and 94 for infections/infestations. Around 3% of patients treated
with SEC discontinued treatment as a result of an AE. Nasopharyngitis and upper
respiratory tract infections were the most commonly reported events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four deaths occurred in patients treated with SEC (one
intracranial haemorrhage, one cardiorespiratory arrest, one alcohol
intoxication and one of unknown cause); all the deaths were deemed unrelated to
the SEC according to the investigators. There were two (0.05%) cases of
suicidality with SEC: one attempted suicide and one case of suicidal ideation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Certolizumab pegol: RAPID-PsA</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the open-label extension study, 393 patients had been
exposed to CZP by week 96 (total exposure 606 patient-years). At week 96, the
incidence of overall treatment-emergent AEs was 87.8% (345/393 patients; 330
per 100 patient-years). The rate of SAEs was 17% (67 patients; 14.5 per 100
patient-years). Around 4% of patients reported a serious infection (16 cases;
3.3 per 100 patient-years) and 14.2% of patients reported an upper respiratory
tract infection (56 patients; 13.7 per 100 patient-years), with no cases of
active TB. Malignancies were reported in 1% of patients (four patients; 0.7 per
100 patient-years).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By 96 weeks, 9.2% of patients had experienced an AE leading
to withdrawal and six patients (1.5%) had experienced an AE leading to death
(two cardiac disorders, one sudden death, one case of breast cancer, one case
of sepsis and one lymphoma). According to the investigator, neither cardiac
events was considered to be related to the study medication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Reviews of safety outcomes for other biologics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Six relevant reviews of AEs were identified from the
searches. The key results for three of these reviews<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>33</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>102</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a

been summarised in a recently published HTA journal publication of a MTA of
anti-TNFs for ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial
spondyloarthritis.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>104</sup></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Cochrane systematic review and NMA of AEs of nine
biologics in adults with any disease (except human immunodeficiency virus
infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) used data from 160 RCTs (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;48,676)
and 46 open-label extension studies (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;11,954).<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>102</sup></a>&nbsp;The
most frequently studied disease in the included trials was RA. When compared
with control treatments, only INF and CZP were statistically significantly
associated with AEs. INF was associated with higher rates of total AEs [number
needed to harm 13, 95% credible interval (CrI) 8 to 505] and withdrawals
because of AEs (number needed to harm 10, 95% CrI 5 to 30). CZP was associated
with higher rates of serious infections (number needed to harm 12, 95% CrI 4 to
79) and SAEs (number needed to harm 18, 95% CrI 9 to 162). An individual
patient data meta-analysis (<i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;22,904 from 74 RCTs)
examining short-term cancer risk associated with ETN, INF and ADA found no
increase in risk of cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (RR 0.99, 95% CI
0.61 to 1.68) when considering all three anti-TNFs together.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>103</sup></a>&nbsp;However,
a doubling in the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was found, with 332 events
per 100,000 person-years in the control group and 655 events per 100,000
person-years in the anti-TNF group [hazard ratio (HR) 2.02, 95% CI 1.11 to
3.95]. NICE TA199<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>33</sup></a>&nbsp;included
a review of studies (including both randomised and non-randomised studies) of
the adverse effects of ETN, INF and ADA. The rates of SAEs covered a broadly
similar range across the three anti-TNFs. However, all estimates were derived
from a highly heterogeneous group of studies in terms of patients, study design
and treatment regimens so reliable estimates of the relative rate of SAEs for
each anti-TNF could not be made.<a

conference abstract reported the odds of a SAE to be statistically
significantly higher for CZP than for placebo (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.16).
Treatment with CZP was also statistically significantly more likely to result
in SAEs than treatment with GOL (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.25), ETN (OR 1.70,
95% CI 1.15 to 2.51) or ADA (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.02). The other

<p class=MsoNormal>Results of a meta-analysis of safety outcomes for CZP</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A review published in 2012 examined the safety of anti-TNFs
for treating psoriasis and PsA and focused mainly on data from European patient
registries of biologics used across a range of diseases (mostly RA).<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>107</sup></a>&nbsp;It
was (at least) partly funded by Pfizer, the manufacturer of ETN, and it did not
appear to be systematic in its methods of selection, critical appraisal and
synthesis of the included studies. It concluded that the safety profile of
monoclonal antibodies (INF and ADA) seems generally less favourable than that
of ETN, particularly in terms of infections, cancer and hepatotoxicity. The
conclusion for infections appeared largely to be based on a BSRBR analysis,
specifically on lower respiratory tract infections, even though a previous
BSRBR study reported no difference in the risk of infection between ADA, ETN
and INF.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>108</sup></a>&nbsp;The
conclusion for cancer appeared to be based on an analysis of a small number
(38) of lymphomas in a case–control study derived from the French Registry of
Infections and Lymphoma in Patients Treated With TNF-&#945; Antagonists (the
data were collected between 2004 and 2006).<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>109</sup></a>&nbsp;The
conclusion for hepatotoxicity was based on a very small number of case reports.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Recent large observational studies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One recent observational study on the safety of biologics in
patients with PsA was identified. It was an Israeli retrospective cohort study
based on a health services database, which reported on 3128 patients between
2002 and 2013. The study examined the association between traditional DMARDs or
anti-TNFs and infection by the herpes zoster virus (shingles). There were 182
cases of herpes zoster infection in 20,096 person-years. The risk of herpes
zoster infection significantly increased in patients treated with a combination
of an anti-TNF and a traditional DMARD, but did not increase significantly with
each of these types of therapy alone.<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>110</sup></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Safety assessments of new treatments can sometimes be
limited in systematic reviews of RCTs because of the small number of trials and
relatively short follow-up durations for which data are available. Where
available, safety data from trials relating to the same treatment for other
indications are therefore sometimes evaluated. For this review, more data from
trials of other patient populations were available for CZP than for SEC. The
results from three systematic reviews<a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>105</sup></a><sup>–</sup><a
href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK458358/"><sup>107</sup></a>&nbsp;(which
looked specifically at AEs) suggested that CZP was associated with
statistically significantly more SAEs and serious infections than placebo. SEC
was not included in these systematic reviews of AEs, probably as a result of
the limited availability of data at the time. Although the safety data for SEC
appear promising, the fairly small number of trials for which data are
currently available means there is still some uncertainty regarding its safety.</p>
